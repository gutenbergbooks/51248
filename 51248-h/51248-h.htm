<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PREFACE</a></h3>


<p>"Nowhere so happy as curled up in a corner with a book."
So said, or is reputed to have said, no less a genius than St.
Thomas à Kempis. And thousands of men and women, boys
and girls, still testify to the truth and power of that saying.
For of all friends or companions a book is the most reliable&mdash;often
quite as helpful as any Jonathan to any David. For
instance, what could have given Abraham Lincoln more lasting
help than those early volumes which he so hungrily devoured
over and over again? "Æsop's Fables," "Robinson
Crusoe," "Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography," "The Pilgrim's
Progress" absorbed every moment he could spare
from his chores and his sleep. Not mere knowledge, but inspiration
entered his soul from those oft-read pages; in them
he gleaned visions of life, its strain and anguish, its exaltation
and thrill; there, too, he caught the secret of that quaint
faculty for terse anecdote by which he was to win his way
not only to the heads but to the hearts of the hardy, courageous
folk of the Middle West, and, later, those of the East as well.
It was through this power to read and understand and enjoy
that Lincoln learned to penetrate to the very soul of mankind,
the deep recesses of the thoughts and feelings of his fellow men.</p>

<p>The will to try, the simple decision to make the effort, is all
that is needed in order to grasp what an infinite fund of amusement
and delight lies stored away in books. No unusual
imaginative powers are requisite to get us on horseback with
Dumas's swashbuckling, duelling musketeers, or to place us
beside Poe's heroes in their dread predicaments. What
friend or acquaintance can tell you half the tales of hair-breadth
escape, side-splitting dilemma, or tender romance,
such as scores of the cleverest writers have spent their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
in devising? These same writers have left this world, they
can never more be seen or heard on earth; but the very
essence of their talent and their personality, their brightest,
most sparkling thoughts and ideas remain, and may readily
be placed within reach of your own hand. Charles Dickens
can never again voyage over the Atlantic and stroll across
Boston Common in velvet coat and plaid waistcoat, gesticulating
with eyes a-twinkle. But his Mr. Pickwick's adventure
with the Middle-Aged Lady in Yellow Curl-Papers still
remains, and the echo of Pickwick's "Bless my soul, what
a dreadful thing" will ring in our ears forever, and forever
stir a quiet chuckle. Rudyard Kipling is growing old, and
his pen no longer flourishes with the reckless vivacity of the
days when he was little more than a "cub" reporter and wrote
"Mandalay." Yet that same "Mandalay" of the "old
Moulmein pagoda" and the "tinkly temple bells" will rouse
a thrill of romance and adventure in thousands of hearts that
are still to be born. Poor Stevenson coughed his life away
at Samoa, after a plucky fight for life that led him to France,
'Frisco, and the South Seas. None the less, though he has
gone from us, the pictures of hope and courage that leap and
laugh at us from his pages are as vivid to-day as when they
first brought their new joy to the delighted world. Read
once more that dainty sketch&mdash;that etching rather&mdash;"A
Night among the Pines," and see for yourself how that great
master of words has voiced our modern appreciation of the
great outdoors. For each great author is an individual, no
two of them are alike, any more than you are like your next-door
neighbor. Their modes of expression, their joy in life
are as varied and divergent as life itself. There is, moreover,
nothing commonplace about them, their work is strong and
fresh. Each has his tale to tell, his song to sing, his meditations
to entrust to us, his own special message to the spirit
or to the intellect of many a generation and many a race.</p>

<p>In other words, all great authors are artists, makers or
shapers of truth and beauty, just as much and in the same
measure as are painters and sculptors. Indeed, Literature
is the chief of the Fine Arts. Music, with all its grandeur and
charm, is but sound, and dies away; Painting, though never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
so rich in color and striking in form, is passive and for the
most part devoid of action, and sad to say, very few of us
have wealth enough to own even one canvas by a master;
Sculpture, with all its dignity and grace, is cold and cheerless
in the main; and Architecture is too bulky and ponderous to
stir personal appreciation at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>In fact, Literature, and Literature alone, possesses the
power of meeting our every mood and desire, for comfort, for
excitement, for exaltation, for pathos, for laughter.</p>

<p>Literature alone can dwell within the walls of the humblest
cabin, even in the squatter's camp in Labrador or Borneo.
Raphael's glorious paintings may only be visited at the expense
of months of time and hundreds of dollars; Beethoven's
symphonies can only be presented by the most finished orchestras
in a few of our largest cities; the statues wrought
by Phidias and Rodin cannot be reproduced by the thousand
and spread broadcast over our nation; Rheims Cathedral and
her sister marvels must stand where first they rose, nor may
they be successfully imitated. But, thank Heaven, Shakespeare,
Dickens, Longfellow for a few cents send their messages
to every soul on earth that can read English.</p>

<p>All of us are acquainted with some half dozen of the immortal
writers of the world, but how many of them have we
never met, perhaps have never heard of. If we could only obtain
an introduction to them; if we only knew which writers
and which of their works to select, all would be well. The
most brilliant, the most lovable, the most sincere, the most
thoughtful authors would gather round us and talk to us;
they would bring their very best to entertain and delight us;
they would offer us their guidance and companionship into
every field of thought. Emerson's calm reflective tones reveal
the answers to many of life's most pressing and significant
problems; Swift, in "Gulliver's Travels," jestingly, yet bitterly,
strips mankind of its pride and conceit, and lays bare
the greed and selfishness that have ruined not individuals
alone, but whole nations and empires; Lewis Carroll talks
the most laughable, clever nonsense that ever inspired a
humorist's pen; Burns, in the simplest of language, voices
the pathos and tragedy of every life, even the humblest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
with our own Lincoln proves again and again that true nobility
may dwell and flourish in the midst of poverty.</p>

<p>Truly, herein lies one of life's chief joys, in encountering
what others have thought and achieved&mdash;in meeting the
actors in the great world drama, the scenes in which they
played their parts, the deeds by which they have won fame
and fortune; still more delectable is the pleasure of whiling
away leisure hours with those folk who are but products of
the fancy, children of the poet's brain, dreams of the teller
of tales: Odysseus, who, for the last three thousand years,
as Sir Philip Sidney has put it, "held children from play and
old men from the chimney corner"; Falstaff, chuckling at
the comical ease with which he hoodwinks all about him;
Lady Macbeth, who, even in her dreams, may not forget the
dread stain upon her little hand; Faust, ever seeking to rid
himself of his demon accomplice; the knights of King Arthur's
round table, Robin Hood and his merry men, Dickens's troop
of immortal grotesques, Bret Harte's rough miners, with their
hearts of gold, Irving's droll New Yorkers of the Knickerbocker
era, Longfellow's Blacksmith and his Evangeline,&mdash;these
and a host of other undying notables have made life
far richer for us all.</p>

<p>Ours is the fault if we do not avail ourselves of their magic.
For here in America the special opportunity to mingle with
them lies readier to the hand than in any other nation. Nowhere
else, not in England, nor France, nor in Italy can the
everyday man find books at his command for the asking. In
a few of the largest European cities, and not anywhere else
on that continent, there are libraries of size and worth, yet
even these are hedged about with a hundred rules and regulations
that hamper circulation. But here, through the
length and breadth of this glorious land, are thousands and
yet more thousands of free libraries, containing all manner
of books, of every age and nation, awaiting your demand.
They contain all that is splendid in the way of printed matter,
but also much, alas, that is not worth any man's time; so
that though the best lies open and free to us, it is mingled
with a vast amount of wretched trash.</p>

<p>Here lies the chief difficulty for us Americans: How are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
we to distinguish the chaff from the wheat, the weeds from
the harvest? The task is that of seeking the proverbial
needle in the haystack. We are deluged with printed matter,
tons upon tons of books and magazines are poured daily
upon the bookseller's counters. What is our chance of
choosing the treasures from out this hodgepodge?</p>

<p>To meet this very problem these volumes have been prepared;
it is hardly our place to dwell upon the years of labor
and thought in which they have gradually taken shape, but
it is perhaps to the point to remark that they represent the
patient effort of many judges and critics to supply an introduction
and a guide to the best and most inspiring literature
of the nations from the beginning of the art to the present
day,&mdash;a means of recreation, amusement, and lasting profit.</p>

<p>In the past three thousand years, some four hundred authors
have achieved such fame and standing as to distinguish them
from the endless multitudes of commonplace penmen. To
choose and present their very best work in complete, unified
selections has constituted the fundamental purpose of these
twelve volumes. In them, it is certain, an amazingly large
proportion of the finest literature has been brought together;
they form a boundless source of entertainment and a wellnigh
infinite field for intellectual diversion and development.</p>

<p>By means of brief and suggestive biographical sketches,
together with the Index and the Handbook, to serve as a
guide to fuller enjoyment and appreciation, the editors have
sought to amplify and enhance the value of the selective feature
of the work. And through an abundance of illustrations,
many of them painstaking reproductions of water color paintings
of the homes and favorite haunts of the chief writers,
additional understanding and pleasure is afforded.</p>

<p>The whole of this work has been built on the central idea of
entertainment that shall be simple and unified. Every effort
has been made to shun the elaborate, intricate methods
that prevail so wastefully to-day in our educational and our
recreational systems. At last educators are openly admitting
that the only sane means of raising our standards of education
must lie in simplifying the quantity of the studies so as to
attain higher quality. In school and out of it, Johnny and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
his sister Molly will unquestionably profit by simple, straightforward
teaching, play, reading, thinking. The more complex
a game is, the fewer people can enjoy it or appreciate its
fine points; the more involved a school system, the fewer
children will be able to acquire thorough training. But
simple games and simple instruction will enable all of us and
of our little ones to get the habit of thoroughness and stability.
These twelve volumes, then, are all constructed upon this
principle of furnishing enjoyment in a simple, clean-cut manner;
they constitute one of the most straightforward, clear,
and forceful means toward the advance of our civilization.</p>

<p>The measure of a successful life is surely the amount of
happiness, of true lasting pleasure which it has contained and
which it has passed on to others. We do not count our years
in terms of sorrow or vexation; we do not recall again and
again our moments of failure or folly; only the bright and
golden hours remain fast emblazoned in our memories, those
days of sunshine and delight, when beauty and laughter sang
in our hearts and the air was filled with music. Of all such
days, those on which the friendly pages of some treasured
author were first opened, or those when we reveled in the
companionship of our favorite heroes of romance and adventure&mdash;those
days indeed are among the brightest of all.
The greater the number of red-letter days of such wonder
and rapture, the greater the value of our lives, not only to
ourselves, but to all who have shared them. In work and in
play, at home and abroad, our undoubted ideal is that of
finding perpetual joy in life. The Fountain of Youth, which
Ponce de Leon vainly sought, is the quest of us all&mdash;we no
longer seek to lengthen our lives, but instead we strive with
might and main to fill them to the very brim with joyous
thoughts and deeds. To be happy is to be forever young.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PURPOSE_OF_THIS_BOOK" id="THE_PURPOSE_OF_THIS_BOOK"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK</a></h3>


<p>It is the easiest thing in the world to open the treasure-vaults
of the Bank of England&mdash;if you have the combination;
if you haven't, the task is hopeless. It is the easiest thing
in the world to enjoy the most brilliant stories, the most
laughable humor, the most heroic deeds that the world has
known&mdash;if you know where to find them.</p>

<p>"Where's something to read, something so interesting that
I can forget how tired I am and what a hard day I had at
the office?" There is the problem of almost every home in
this country. Tired men and women must have some means
of refreshing themselves, of forgetting their worries and trials
for a time. They must rest and gather strength for the next
day's work. Where are they going to get it?</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is to give the owners of <span class="smcap">The
Library of Entertainment</span> an easy answer to that question.
Its opening pages contain some unusual notes on the oddities
of literary folk and some suggestions for hours and hours of
entertainment and amusement that will drive away care and
fatigue unfailingly. The brightest stories and the most
fascinating humor are put right on the table beside you, all
you have to do is to turn to them according to the directions
in these pages.</p>

<p>But there is something better still in this little volume. It
gives a true opportunity to enjoy the company of the ablest
men and women who have ever put pen to paper. Until now
a college course of three or four years has been the only means
of getting in touch with the best of good, sensible reading.
Our schools do not teach us how to understand and take pleasure
in these books; our libraries only store them for us to
use if we already know about them. Recent figures show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
for some time past more than 10,000 new books have been
published in the United States each year, an equal number in
England, and even more in Germany and Russia. The public
libraries contain millions upon millions printed in the past.
It would be impossible for even a hundred men giving their
whole lifetime of eighty years to do as much as scan the pages
of all the world's literature.</p>

<p>Therefore it is only too evident that for the sensible use of
the little time which we can give to reading we should be enabled
to make a selection. We must be started on the right
road. This is the express aim of <span class="smcap">The Library of Entertainment</span>.
Until now the pleasure and the distinction that
come from being well-read have belonged to a few. The
combination that opens the treasure-vaults of literature was
only given in college lectures. The outside world has been
left to shift for itself. But this is utterly wrong; with the
simple introduction that is given in Part Two of this book
the world of literature and its lasting delights are open to all.</p>

<h3><a name="SIDE-LIGHTS_ON_GREAT_WRITERS" id="SIDE-LIGHTS_ON_GREAT_WRITERS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">SIDE-LIGHTS ON GREAT WRITERS</a></h3>


<p>To many of us it seems as if an author with an assured
reputation must be one of the happiest of men; yet some of
the very greatest have suffered almost intolerably.</p>

<p>Bobby Burns was a victim of drink largely because of his
brilliant imagination and extreme sensitiveness. He was
petted by society and praised as the poet of the future; all
England was at his feet. Yet he gave way to his passions,
took to drink, and ruined the lives of several of his dearest
friends, as well as his own. In almost anyone else this would
condemn him absolutely; but the truth is that his poetic
powers, the gift of his genius, rendered him too sensitive to
moods of the moment, and his will could not hold out under
the strain.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar case was that of Coleridge. In his
youth he showed extraordinary talent, but he fell a victim to
opium and the greater part of his life was wasted in a series
of unfinished efforts. No opium was necessary to stimulate
his imagination, as his weird ballad of "The Ancient Mariner"
plainly shows. Indeed his genius even worked during his
sleep, for "Kubla Khan" is but a fragment of a poem which
he dreamed and then began to write down as soon as he awoke.
If he had not been interrupted by a visitor, a man of no
importance, we might have had the whole instead of a scanty
portion of this unique masterpiece. Even as it stands it is
one of the most picturesque and brilliant compositions ever
produced. It seems incredible that it should be the work of
a sleeping brain. And yet this is the man who gave himself
up to opium, wrecking a career that promised to surpass
even that of Byron or Shelley in poetic power.</p>

<p>Thomas De Quincey, the author of the "Confessions of an
Opium Eater," drank laudanum by the glassful. He first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
took to using this liquid form of opium in order to gain relief
from the dyspepsia that resulted from his days of privation
in the streets of London. Of course he was unable to stop
the use of the drug and had to increase the doses to the
alarming extent mentioned. When he was living in Edinburgh
this almost caused the death of a gentleman who dined
with him there; for his visitor picked up a decanter of a rich,
dark red liquor, which he thought was port wine, poured out
a glass, and had it at his lips, when De Quincey hurriedly
seized it and saved the situation. Smoking opium was not
the custom then; Coleridge drank it, as De Quincey did,
and unknowingly spread the habit; for a poor man who
once lived near Coleridge's house admitted that he had obtained
laudanum from a boy who worked for Coleridge and
smuggled it out to his friend by the bottleful.</p>

<p>As we all know, our great American short story writer,
Edgar Allan Poe, was the prey of alcohol and also of opium,
as well as a genius. The combination seems to have been
more unavoidable in his case than in any other we know of.
His imagination could only bring forth those extraordinarily
gruesome tales of mystery and horror when stimulated by
wines and brandy or opium. His whole life was spent in the
shadow of despondency and irritation; and although we are
indebted to him for priceless literary gems, he paid the penalty
with misery which we cannot imagine.</p>

<p>In contrast, look at the life of Charles Lamb. He was a
poor clerk at a pitiful salary, struggling to increase his income
by literary work in his spare time, with a dangerous appetite
for alcohol, and an insane sister to take care of. He, himself,
constantly dreaded insanity. Yet he kept up a cheerful and
continual resistance to his craving for drink, although he often
took a drop too much. In order to care for his sister, who had
killed her mother in one of her attacks, he gave up his sweetheart
and settled down to the brave and heartrending task
of devotion to the unhappy invalid. This lasted for thirty-three
years, during which he never murmured except when
her attacks forced him to place her in an asylum. One of
his friends leaves the record of meeting Charles and Mary
Lamb walking across the fields to the hospital with tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
streaming down their faces. Yet in spite of all his troubles
Lamb's essays have a delicacy and a cheerfulness that never
reveal the burden he had to bear. He is one of the great
heroes of English literature.</p>

<p>John Milton was another such hero. As a young man
he won great distinction as a poet and a scholar; so much so
that when he went to Italy the greatest Italian authors and
critics praised his Italian and Latin poetry as the best of
that day, superior to anything written during that time in
Italy itself. He was received there with boundless enthusiasm
and was having the time of his life, so to speak, when the
news reached him of the Puritan rebellion against Charles
the First. Without a moment's hesitation he abandoned his
tour and came back to England. There he acted as foreign
correspondent for Cromwell's Government and kept England
safe from attacks by France and the rest of Europe through
his able diplomacy. He worked day and night until he fell
ill and eventually lost his eyesight. To make matters worse,
the Puritans were deprived of their power and Milton's
enemies then persecuted him so that he had to fly for his life.
He spent the rest of his days in a humble cottage, while his
daughters grumbled because he made them transcribe "Paradise
Lost" and "Paradise Regained." It seems as if his
sacrifice for his country was utterly unrewarded, until we remember
that his name to-day is almost the first in its long roll
of poets.</p>

<p>One of the sorrows of literary men is lack of appreciation.
Longfellow was laughed at by the Harvard students whom
he taught, for his poems had no attraction for them and he
was only appreciated elsewhere. Bret Harte wrote the finest
stories of California life that have ever appeared, yet for years
he was not recognized in this country as a writer of unusual
powers, and as a matter of fact he spent the greater part of
his life in London, six thousand miles from his old home;
Lafcadio Hearn was so homely and eccentric that he could
not be happy or comfortable in the United States or in Europe,
and took refuge in Japan where his appearance would never
be remarked. As he points out in his wonderful writings on
Japanese life, politeness is one of the ruling habits of that race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
so that he was made far more comfortable and did far better
work than would have been possible in his own country.</p>

<p>Some writers have done their best work in prison. "The
Star Spangled Banner," as we know, was written by Francis
Scott Key, while he was a captive on a British battleship
during the bombardment of Fort McHenry, near Baltimore,
in the War of 1812, and as he wondered whether the flag was
still flying he jotted down the lines of our National Anthem.
The masterpiece of Spanish literature was written in jail;
"Don Quixote" is so amusing, so pathetic, and so vivid that
Spain can stake her whole reputation on that one work,
written by Cervantes, an innocent man, imprisoned through
envy and malice. John Bunyan, another guiltless author,
wrote his immortal "Pilgrim's Progress" while he was locked
up for his stubborn refusal to mold his religious belief according
to the demands of authorities for whom he could have no
respect. The opium of Coleridge and De Quincey and the
brandy of Edgar Allan Poe never stimulated them to equal
the work of these two geniuses. Innocence in prison has been
proved superior to dissipation in the best of surroundings,
for the opium victims, Coleridge and De Quincey, had the
society of England's most brilliant men and the environment
of her finest scenery.</p>

<p>Both Bunyan and Cervantes worked hard, but the hardest
workers of all have been Frenchmen; Balzac and Dumas
labored unceasingly for the greater part of their lifetimes.
In twenty years Balzac wrote ninety-seven novels for a mere
pittance that just kept body and soul together. The greatness
of his work was recognized, but the French public, as
a whole, did so little reading, that the publisher himself did
not make anything like a fortune. Dumas was more popular
and employed a staff of assistants to collect the material for
his historical romances, but the actual writing was all his own
and cost him from fourteen to eighteen hours a day in labor.
His works are more numerous than those of Dickens, Thackeray,
and Cooper combined. It seems incredible that one
man could have turned out such a tremendous mass of fascinating
stories.</p>

<p>The only man in English literature who is to be compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to these two Frenchmen is Sir Walter Scott. In his first
success, when money flowed in on him almost in torrents, his
vanity led him to build the mansion of Abbotsford and his
one wish was to be regarded as the Squire or ruler of the
countryside, but not long after, when his partner in the publishing
business had caused the failure of the firm, he bravely
went to work and wrote novel after novel, year after year, to
pay off his debts. His vanity and love of show disappeared
and the man's true nobility took its proper place; almost on
his death-bed he continued to dictate his novels although he
was agonized with pain and distress.</p>

<p>Similar patience was shown by Thomas Carlyle, who rewrote
the whole of his great work, "The French Revolution,"
after the first copy had been carelessly burnt by a servant
girl in the house of a friend who had borrowed the manuscript.
He was a dyspeptic and a constant grumbler, but on this
occasion he redeemed himself by sitting down quietly to work
and hammering away at his dreary task until he had once more
finished the masterpiece. Carlyle was so sensitive to noise
and other disturbances that he had a sound-proof shed or
room built on the roof of his house in London, where he did
a great part of his writing, and even there he complained of
the rumbling of the wagons in the street, which vibrated
through the house.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, the great English philosopher, was also
easily disturbed by noises, but he solved the problem by
wearing ear muffs which were specially made under his instruction.
Spencer was rather irritable, it is said; certainly
on one occasion he made himself a source of amusement when
he objected to being beaten at billiards by the son of a friend
of his and remarked that it was not fitting that a young man
should have spent so much time and money on so foolish a
pastime; yet when he won, the expenditure of thought and time
on the part of so great a philosopher seemed altogether wise.</p>

<p>Robert Browning had an amusing experience on one occasion
toward the close of his life. He was walking through the
residential district of London's fashionable West End to a
meeting which he had been invited to attend. Mistaking
the house, he walked into a literary gathering that was dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>cussing
his own poems. Presently he rose to his feet and
offered a few suggestions as to the meaning of a rather difficult
passage. Now Browning was not at all like a poet in appearance,
but rather resembled a prosperous business man, and
it happened that as he was well toward the back of the hall
no one recognized him. On the contrary his suggestions were
ridiculed by other critics who took the floor when he sat down
and he retired unrecognized but vastly delighted. Of course
some of Browning's work is intensely intricate and confused;
he himself said of his early poem "Sordello" that once there
were two beings who understood it, the Almighty and Robert
Browning; now, he added, there was but one, for Browning
had long lost the key to its problem.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens was one of the most impressionable writers
who ever lived. His characters were absolutely real to him
and when he was writing he would impersonate the various
characters he was describing, talking, making faces, jumping
up and looking in the mirror, and then dashing back to his
desk to set down each inspiration. But his impressionable
nature prevented complete happiness; he was either intensely
happy or down in the dumps and miserable. This made him
very hard to get along with, so that it is no wonder that his
wife found it almost impossible to live with him.</p>

<p>Gladstone, the 'Grand Old Man' of English politics in the
last century, was a scholar and a linguist as well as a statesman.
On one occasion he was seated in the House of Commons
while his bitter opponent, the clever Disraeli, was delivering
a venomous and brilliant attack upon him. During
the speech Gladstone was observed to be writing on a scrap
of paper, apparently taking notes for his reply. At the conclusion
of his enemy's speech Gladstone rose and delivered
a most masterly refutation of the attack, answering and
breaking down each point of Disraeli's invective with the
utmost skill. A member sitting near by noticed that the scrap
of paper was lying on Gladstone's seat and picked it up to
see what the notes were like; to his surprise they consisted of
a careful translation of "Rock of Ages" into smooth Greek
verse, which the orator had made half-consciously while
waiting for the occasion to reply to his opponent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Macaulay, too, had wonderful scholastic talent and a
fine memory. Even in his youth he showed great ability
and read with amazing speed; most remarkable is the fact
that he never seemed to forget a line he had read, but could
repeat pages of an author many years after he had once perused
his work. He read many works again and again, it is
true, but for the pleasure of enjoying the fine points of style
rather than for the sake of attaining greater familiarity with
the book. His essays are regarded as among the most brilliant
in the language, and seem to have been written posthaste,
at full swing. In reality, however, he was well pleased
if he produced five foolscap pages of longhand manuscript
a day. It was his custom to spend the morning writing as
fast as he could, the afternoon, in revising and pruning the
morning's work and thus producing finished copy. He
knew only too well that, as Sheridan said, "easy writing makes
cursed hard reading," and that labor alone could produce a
forceful and pleasant style.</p>

<p>Goethe, the greatest of the German immortals, is mainly
remembered as a poet. Yet his fame would be great even if
it depended only upon his scientific exploits. It was he
who did much toward establishing the modern theory of
evolution. Goethe also showed his insight into human progress
by prophesying the construction of the Suez and the
Panama Canals as long ago as 1827; this illustrates the
marvelous imagination of the genius who was, as he himself
said, a citizen of the world.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is certainly the supreme master of English
literature, yet there was a time when he was regarded as a
nuisance and a good-for-nothing. He was a poacher, a
thieving vagabond arrested for stealing or killing deer in the
park of the neighboring aristocrat, Sir Thomas Lucy. It
was not long afterward that the future playwright went to
London and gained his first acquaintance with the theater
by holding horses for gentlefolk at the entrance of the principal
playhouse of the city. Some authors would also call him a
pirate and a thief, as Sir Thomas Lucy did, for he took plots
and ideas wherever he found them and worked them over
into the revised versions that now rank among the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
achievements of mankind. Yet all the while his one desire
was to be a well-to-do business man of his native town of
Stratford, and as soon as he had made a comfortable fortune
he retired and spent his last years in quiet, building a new
house and writing one or two last plays in the commonplace
seclusion of a country town. There is still one place left in
London where his plays were performed under his direction,
although the old theaters have long since perished. This is
the Temple Hall, in the grounds that belonged to the old
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Knights Templars'">Knights Templar</ins> of Crusading fame. Here he put on "The
Winter's Tale" with great success. If you are ever in London
you can visit the hall and on entering you can turn the very
door-handle, so tradition says, which the poet himself used.</p>

<p>Molière was the greatest French dramatist. At the height
of his career, legend relates, he was such a favorite with the
grand monarch, Louis XIV, that this proud king made him
come and dine in private with him, so as to convince his
servants and courtiers that the genius whom they thought of
as a vulgar, impossible boor, a mere actor, was worthy of the
greatest consideration. Yet when Molière was dead the
king ungratefully refused to see that he was properly buried
and the great man was carried to his last resting-place with
little ceremony.</p>

<p>At the present day one of France's most prominent writers
is Rostand, the author of "Cyrano de Bergerac," a play which
brought him into instant popularity through its brilliance,
although a few weeks before scarcely anyone had heard his
name. On the first night of the production, in 1897, the
audience cheered and shouted until it seemed as if the performance
would break up in the confusion created by its success,
yet thanks to Rostand's coolness the actors and even
the spectators were kept calm enough to carry the play through
to its masterly conclusion. At the close, when the curtain
had fallen on the last act, Rostand was sought for everywhere
to make his bow to the enthusiastic audience, but he
had quietly driven away to his country home, with his wife,
and there he stayed for a week or more before the public had
a chance to welcome him.</p>

<p>Byron is almost the only man in English letters to come so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
suddenly before the people. He woke up one morning to
find himself famous, through the publication of "Childe
Harold." Byron was another of the unhappy geniuses.
He was hot-headed and married an equally irritable wife, so
naturally they separated, with anger and yet with sorrow.
His little daughter, who he said was the one friend he had in
the world, died at an early age. He dreaded being fat and
therefore starved himself, a process which did not make him
happier. But his death was in itself enough to redeem him
in spite of his irresponsible and rather selfish career, for he
gave himself up to the cause of the freedom and independence
of the Greeks, and died of fever contracted while preparing
for the great campaign against the Turks.</p>

<p>Poor Dean Swift, the author of "Gulliver's Travels," the
bitterest book ever written about human beings, suffered
even more than Byron. He was keenly sensitive, and his
political labors were poorly paid because he was none too
courteous in his manner to the political leaders for whom he
worked so hard. Boot-licking would have brought him the
position he desired, but Swift was not a toady, so he was
driven to accept the second-rate place offered him, and there
vented his anger in the most savage attacks on human nature
that can be imagined. All this while he had been fearing
that his mind would give way; "I am like that tree," he said
to a friend one day when they were out walking, "I shall die
at the top first." He was right, for not long afterward his
brain gave way.</p>

<p>"The Old Oaken Bucket" still has a touch of beauty for
us, if we do not hear it too often. It was written under
rather interesting circumstances. Samuel Woodworth, the
author, was born and brought up on a little farm in Scituate,
not far from Plymouth, Massachusetts. In his youth he
went to New York and got a job as a reporter. One day he
was in a bar, taking a glass of brandy and declaring that it
was the finest drink on earth, when a friend with him said,
"You're wrong; think of the delicious water you used to draw
from the old well at home." Woodworth jumped up and
hurried over to his rooms, where he sat down and dashed off
the outline of the song that at once won a widespread vogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the bravest fight against ill health was put up by
Robert Louis Stevenson, the gentle, lovable poet and novelist.
As a young man he found that consumption threatened to
carry him off. With the cheerfulness characteristic of the
victims of the White Plague he set off on a series of outdoor
trips afoot and afloat. Two of these are preserved for us in
his "Inland Voyage" and the more fascinating "Travels with
a Donkey." This latter is almost unequaled as a picture of
travel. He finally started for America to see if the climate
there would not be better for him than the moist weather of
Scotland, his home. Eventually he reached Samoa, in the
South Seas of the Pacific, where he lived for several years,
cheerful and brave in spite of his increasing weakness. His
character, although mild and kindly, was so forceful that the
chiefs among the natives held him in veneration, and at the
time of his death no one lamented him more than the simple
Samoans, some of whom bore him to the grave on the hill-top
near his home.</p>

<p>Thoreau, one of New England's philosophers of the great
and glorious Emerson days, was as eccentric as any one that
can be found. For the sake of peace and independence he
went off into the woods and lived as a hermit near Walden
Pond, outside Concord. To earn what little money he needed
he made lead pencils; like many country folks of those days
he was amazingly dexterous with his knife and his pencils
were a delight to use. In his leisure he made an exhaustive
study of the Pond; but in two years' time he left this little
cabin and never returned. He said that he had had enough
of that sort of life and now he was going to try something
else. His was the same spirit of adventure that stirred the
old explorers and yet he was so fond of New England that he
rarely set foot outside her boundaries. He could find enough
to keep him busy thinking and writing within his own dooryard.
But he showed that it was possible for a man in good
health to live on less than $100 a year and have more than
two thirds of his time to himself. On the other hand, as
he died of consumption at the age of forty-four, he also
proved that outdoor life is not in itself a preventive of that
scourge.</p>

<p>Whittier, the gentle Quaker poet, was one of the sturdiest
heroes of the antislavery movement. In those days he was
a fighter, stoned and mobbed by the partisans of slavery in
Philadelphia and Concord, New Hampshire. His genius was
discovered by William Lloyd Garrison, the abolitionist, while
he was editing a paper at Newburyport. Whittier's sister
had sent some verses of her young brother's to the paper
and Garrison not only printed them but hunted up the
author to enlist him in his good work. In his latter years
Whittier clung to the rural obscurity of Amesbury, where he
enjoyed the rippling life of the little town, talking local
politics with the 'natives' in the country store, chatting
with his friends on the doorstep of the Friends' meeting-house
which he had helped to build, or planting trees about
it, like Holmes, who used to boast that at one time or another
he had set out more than seven hundred saplings.
Whittier, more than any other American, has left us glowing
pictures of New England life and geniality. With his
reverent sense of the need for emphasizing morals and duty
there was a love of home, of the memory of youth's work
and play that makes "Snow-Bound" immortal. Emerson
was the Yankee philosopher; Hawthorne, the novelist of
New England's moods; Thoreau, the nature-worshiper;
Holmes, the Bostonian; Longfellow, the cosmopolitan poet;
but Whittier was the poet of New England's heart.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_STUDY_OF_LITERATURE" id="THE_STUDY_OF_LITERATURE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE STUDY OF LITERATURE</a></h3>


<p>We are told there is no royal road to learning; no short
cut to the understanding and appreciation of literature.
We are told that we must admire Homer, or Addison, or some
other immortal author, but no one tells us <em>why</em> or <em>how</em>. No
explanation is given of the reason why their work is deservedly
immortal. Our schools do not introduce us to the delights of
good reading; instead, they handle a few stories and essays
as if they were Latin or algebra, making drudgery out of what
ought to be enjoyment. The result is that we are frightened
away from the great writers; their work is supposed to be a
mystery, only to be revealed to those who give years of labor
to its study.</p>

<p>But no one is so dull or so heedless of pleasure as not to
accept the means of lasting delight when it is put right in
front of them. Thousands of people are waiting for the
chance to get in touch with the good sense, rousing style, and
splendid ideas of the masters of literature. That is why this
volume has been prepared. It furnishes a direct and attractive
road straight to the heart of literature. It has been laid
out systematically so as to be a simple and practical guide.</p>

<p>The leading characteristics of each era, each nation, and
each division of literature have been tersely stated, with the
authors under each of these classifications listed beneath.
The noblest and most fascinating works gain tenfold in interest
through the knowledge of these fundamental facts. With
them before you, you command a view, not merely of one
single author, but of the whole movement of which he was a
part. You see the ideas and lines of thought from which a
book has sprung, the hidden forces which went into the making
of it. Each book stands in association with those of the
same literary class, or nation, or period; their relationship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with the rest of literature is at once apparent. In this way
the wasteful drudgery and folly of aimless reading is avoided.
The study of literature pursued with the means here given
cannot be tedious, for it is straightforward, simple, and clear.</p>

<p>The results that are to be expected from the limited time
which most of us can devote to reading are more extensive
than might be thought. In this connection read the following
selections, practical and full of common sense, each of
them throwing light on the subject of reading.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DECISIVE_PERIODS_IN_LITERATURE" id="THE_DECISIVE_PERIODS_IN_LITERATURE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE DECISIVE PERIODS IN LITERATURE</a></h3>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">First of all</span>: <b>What is Literature?</b></p>

<p class="p1 center"><b>The expression of thought upon the countless phases of life
and the universe as felt by the greatest intellects.</b></p>


<p>There are innumerable views to be taken of this world of
ours; each of us sees it a little differently, the problem of
life strikes a nation or an age or an individual in ever changing
ways. Homer saw it in heroic terms, Swift, in "Gulliver's
Travels," looked at it savagely and sadly, Bunyan, in
the "Pilgrim's Progress," saw the religious side. These
authors not only saw but felt; their feelings took possession
of them, they had to write them down and give them expression.
Gray, the author of the immortal "Elegy in a Country
Churchyard," took seven years to perfect the expression of
the feelings roused by what he saw in that secluded village
nook. Poe chose every word of his "Tales of Mystery and
Imagination" with the utmost care. The labor of composition
was solely for the purpose of giving the reader exactly the
impression and emotion desired; for the sake of clearness,
force, and ease.</p>


<p class="p2">In the second place: Each of the great periods in history
has had certain traits and has excelled in some particular
field of literature. The traits and the works of an era have
been molded by preceding ages and likewise have brought
about the development of the periods which followed. Vergil
was influenced by Homer and the whole tradition of Greek
literature; Shakespeare and the rest of the Elizabethan
writers are products of the fresh outburst of activity which
we call the Renaissance; Kipling has profited by the work
of Dickens, Poe, Milton, Chaucer, and a host of other authors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
If we are to appreciate a writer, then, we must know the chief
characteristics of these great literary epochs.</p>

<p><b>The Age of the Ancients.</b> 1500 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>&ndash;500 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> From the
dawn of history to the fall of the Roman Empire, all the
principal forms of literary expression were developed, at
least two of which, epic poetry and tragedy, have never been
surpassed. Yet the world was very small then; it was merely
the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Its ideals were narrow,
limited by paganism and slavery. For those who wrote and
those who read there was no struggle for existence, they were
waited on by their slaves, they had no faith in a life after
death; whether thinkers or heedless wasters, they were
selfishly living for to-day and not for the morrow. The
bulk of the people were ignorant, even when not enslaved.
As their literature was the product of an aristocracy, leading
a life of leisure, it was inevitably stately, reserved, and formal
in its tone, except in the earliest productions before society
had emerged completely from barbarism.</p>

<p><b>The Dark Ages.</b> 500 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>&ndash;1000 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> Crippled by pride
and selfishness Roman civilization was swept away by wave
after wave of barbarian invasions. Goths, Visigoths, Ostrogoths,
Huns, Lombards, and Vandals in turn swarmed over
the face of Europe, spreading terror and desolation. Learning,
art, industry, and government perished. But the
invaders brought a love of freedom, a hatred of bondage
and captivity, to offset their contempt for the progress effected
by the great thinkers and rulers of antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>There is but little left to us of the scanty literature produced
in those dim centuries. It is all primitive, Homeric;
rhythmic tales of the heroic lives and deaths of national
leaders constitute the sole endeavor that has lasted. But
in these is <em>the note of freedom</em>, for the masses of the people
as well as the rulers and nobles delighted in Charlemagne and
his peerless knight Roland, or in Eric, the Viking adventurer,
who dared to sail far forth to Vinland. The great ruler was
not a mere commander but a leader whom men of every class
gladly followed with love as well as respect. Yet the ideals
were low, mainly of physical prowess and sheer brute strength.</p>

<p><b>The Middle Ages.</b> 1000 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>&ndash;1400 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> However, as soon
as the dread of barbarian havoc had passed and peace and
government had been restored to some extent, a new and
brighter era began. The thirst for learning has never been
greater than at this time. Students flocked to the universities
of Paris, Oxford, and Bologna in thousands, begging their
way, traveling on foot for hundreds of miles. Religion
seized men even more firmly, finding them active or meditative
occupations either in the monasteries or in the Crusades.
The aspirations of the time appear in the legends of King
Arthur and the Round Table, as told in the prose of the day
by Sir Thomas Malory or in the more recent verse of Tennyson's
"Idylls of the King." This is the chivalric ideal of
perfect knighthood. The religious feeling is shown in such
hymns as the "Stabat Mater," the "Dies Iræ," or "Jerusalem
the Golden." Dante, commonly reckoned the second
of the world's poets, proves the zeal for learning and scholarship.
The spirit of freedom gleams from the "Old English
Ballads" of Robin Hood, the enemy of the oppressive nobles
and the friend of the poor and the humble. It is even more
evident in the work of John Wyclif, who translated the Bible
into English so that the common peasant might have the
advantage of hearing the Gospel message read to him in a
tongue that he understood, and that he might feel that the
teachings of religion were meant for him as much as for the
wealthy and the learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But science and thought had not yet startled men into
recognition of the wonder round about them. Knowledge
was assumed to be complete. To probe into the mysteries
of nature was unholy and wicked in those days. The awakening
from unseeing and unreasoning childhood to the adventuresome
zest of youth and young manhood was yet to come.</p>

<p><b>The Renaissance.</b> 1400&ndash;1600. The gradual increase of
knowledge and better government toward the close of the
Middle Ages caused a desire for higher things. This hidden
desire suddenly broke loose with astonishing force when the
art of printing was discovered, about 1450. Information
had hitherto been spread only by word of mouth or by laboriously
copying a volume by hand. The process in either
case was slower than we can imagine. But now new ideas,
rare books, foreign teaching could be spread broadcast like
wildfire.</p>

<p>It also happened at just this time that Constantinople was
taken by the Turks (1453). The greatest treasures of Greek
literature had been jealously hidden away there for centuries.
Now that the scholars had to fly for their lives they let loose
a store of new thought on the nations of western Europe.
Taking refuge in Italy they brought with them these rich
volumes. The Italian enthusiasm and the ardor with which
these discoveries were published to the world spread like fire
through France and Germany and England.</p>

<p>Everywhere mankind awoke; never before or since have
people lived so strenuously. Their newly awakened curiosity
drove them round the Cape of Good Hope and across the
Atlantic Ocean. Exploration and adventure, the invasion of
Mexico and the Americas as well as the Orient, the search
for gold and for happiness went hand in hand. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
time Luther roused northern Europe with his demand for
religious reform and founded the Protestant church. In
England Shakespeare and his companions had discovered a
new field of literary venture and produced plays by the hundred,
many of them immortal. The modern world of action
and progress had at last come of age.</p>

<p>The passing of the old ideals, of chivalry and monkish study,
is nowhere better shown than in "Don Quixote." The love
of creative art hand in hand with adventure echoes through
every page of Cellini's "Autobiography." Francis Bacon
discovered a new method of reasoning; Montaigne did
what had not been thought of for hundreds of years, and began
to study his own personality, the workings of his mind,
and the problems which he found in his own life within himself;
Sir Thomas More also took up a subject that had not
been touched for seventeen centuries and drew a wonderful
picture of an ideal government in his "Utopia." Columbus
and a whole squadron of others sailed the unknown seas.
The Elizabethan nobles, like Sir Philip Sidney and Sir Walter
Raleigh, were poets, statesmen, courtiers, and generals all
at once.</p>

<p><b>The Age of Classicism.</b> 1600&ndash;1776. By 1600 imagination
and the creative spirit were running riot. The exuberance
of wonder and discovery had led to a wordy and confused
style of writing. It was time for this unbalanced disorderly
manner to be subjected to sound criticism and to be regulated
by laws of composition.</p>

<p>This is precisely what happened. Enthusiasm and inventive
power were wearied, and thinking men began to criticize
and judge the work that was being done. It was clear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
them that there was need of proportion and symmetry, that
each act of a play, for example, should do its special part in
the development of the plot and in the revelation of the characters.
The problem in the scholar's mind was: What is
the best possible form or model to follow in making a play,
a song, or a speech? Wise men came to the conclusion that
the classic authors of ancient literature furnished the best
examples, and this is why the period is called the Age of
Classicism.</p>

<p>It was characterized by the use of reason and judgment,
rather than feeling and inspiration, by convention and law,
by restraint and dignity. In fact the wilder side of nature
was actually disliked; the Alps were not grand, but barbaric
and odious, in the eyes of the literary men of that day. Dr.
Johnson, in his famous Dictionary, defines a mountain as
"a protuberance on the face of nature." The rich land-owners
altered the landscapes on their great estates, smoothed
out the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'inelegancies'">inelegances</ins> of the meadows, cut trees down and
planted others, laid out geometrically correct roads and
paths, and altogether 'improved' nature until the whole
scene was thoroughly artificial; very trim and neat, but
very unnatural.</p>

<p>In literature it was much the same. Poetry, such as Pope's,
seems stilted and affected to us; the plays of Racine, the
opposite of Shakespeare's, are formal and long-winded, so
exalted in tone and so restrained in their phrasing that they
are dignity indeed, but nothing else.</p>

<p>Yet the movement was beneficial because it cut away the
extravagances of the earlier period. It also produced a new
branch of literature, the critical essay. The essays of Bacon
and Montaigne had been philosophical. Those of Addison
and Steele dealt with life and literature critically, using fable
and fiction to give point to their verdicts in enforcement of
law and convention.</p>

<p>But writing based on the ancient classics demanded a highly
educated public. Only the wealthy could obtain the education
necessary. Besides, the aristocracy held that the common
people should be kept in their place, that learning and scholarship
were not for them. The life of thought and progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was remote from the mass of the population, just as the government
was carried on without reference to their needs or wishes.</p>

<p><b>The Age of Romanticism.</b> 1776&ndash;1832. The Revolution
in America, soon followed by that in France, is the historical
sign of the passing of the aristocratic spirit of classicism.
Freedom, equality, the destruction of the bondage that had
held the common people back from education and advancement,
these are the new ideas. In literature as in life a reaction
broke out against the formal, stilted, unemotional
style of classicism. Wordsworth and Byron in England,
Rousseau in France, and Goethe and Schiller in Germany
were the leaders in the intellectual activity. Their writings
and their principles were directly opposed to their predecessors.
Liberty, instead of convention; free expression of
passion and feeling, in the place of cold reasoning; individual
expression instead of imitation and studied restraint; simple
words and direct, clear statement in the place of an affected
and artificial style; a love for the wild and picturesque in
scenery rather than for the smooth and cultivated parks of
the past century. Contrast Byron with Pope, or Scott's
novels with Johnson's "Rasselas" to see the radical difference
in tone.</p>

<p>This outburst of freedom and self-expression meant progress.
To increase the advance, steam and machinery came
into use; just as printing accomplished marvels in the days
of the Renaissance, so now there was again a blaze of creative
genius and inventiveness. National education at the expense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>of the state and the growth of newspapers and magazines
put rich and poor, noble and peasant more nearly on a level
than any bloodshed or lawmaking could ever have done.</p>

<p><b>The Nineteenth Century</b>. The first glow of the romantic
enthusiasm soon died away and the new forces of industry
and commerce took possession of Europe and America.</p>

<p>But the swift onrush of manufacturing and trading called
for armies of accountants, skilled workers, and salesmen.
These made up a new class of society; hitherto there had been
aristocrats and peasants, educated and ignorant, rich and
poor. The army of business employees, alert, vigorous,
ready for any quantity of reading-matter that would amuse or
furnish knowledge, added their countless numbers to the reading
public. Fiction, at first in the novel, and later in the
short story, was published as fast as it could be printed.
This great middle class itself provided material for genius
to work on. Dickens and George Eliot are striking examples
of authors who wrote about this new middle class in order to
amuse it. The influence of business life made the world more
matter of fact and in consequence literature became rather
more prosaic, with a tendency to present a realistic picture
of everyday life and manners. Science, aided by a multitude
of mechanical inventions, made unprecedented progress and
assumed a more important place in the minds of men than
ever before. History was treated scientifically, thought was
more systematic than ever, the nineteenth century presented
a union of the enthusiasm of the Renaissance, the love of
system of the Classic Age, and the devotion to nature of the
Romantic Period.</p>

<h3><a name="NATIONAL_CHARACTERISTICS" id="NATIONAL_CHARACTERISTICS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS</a></h3>


<p>Each of the nations, like each of the great eras of human
progress, possesses definite characteristics of its own. Frenchmen
differ from Englishmen in their faces, their customs, and
also in intellectual trend. Shakespeare is unlike Ibsen not
simply because he lived at an earlier date, in another epoch,
but also because he was the native of another country. Kipling's
point of view is not the same as that of Thomas Bailey
Aldrich; their national traditions and surroundings varied
sufficiently to leave a mark upon their work so legible that
one is recognized as English and the other as American without
need of referring to their biographies.</p>

<p>It is necessary, then, to have in mind the traits that individualize
nations and races. For this reason the national characteristics
are here set forth briefly, with lists of the principal
authors of each country.</p>

<p><b>Greek Literature.</b> An unequaled perception of beauty,
with a love of symmetry and proportion: the reason and the
feelings, the intellect and the emotions are perfectly blended.
The powers of imagination and creation are highly trained,
as well as the logical faculty, resulting in the perfection of
skill and insight in epic poetry (Homer), tragedy (Æschylus,
Euripides, and Sophocles), and philosophy (Plato).</p>

<p><b>Latin Literature.</b> The power of organization, with an
ardor for law and order, combined with a genius for adapting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and utilizing the best products of the nations which came
under the Roman rule. This talent for adaptation and
imitation stands in contrast to the Greek creative talent.
Inasmuch as Rome's greatest literary works belong to a
period four centuries after the best Greek production, it follows
that the Roman authors profited not only by Greek
achievement but also by the increased knowledge of the world
due to the vast extension of the Roman Empire. Apart from
this broader point of view, Latin authors borrowed method
and style from the Greek; Vergil follows Homer and Theocritus,
who was also imitated by Horace. Cicero and Seneca
took both thought and style from Greek philosophers. In
fact, Athens was the university at which all well-educated
Romans had studied.</p>

<p><b>English Literature.</b> England's isolation as an island has
enabled her to develop a national literature continuously for
nine centuries with only the slightest interruption from the
world without. Foreign ideas have been introduced, certainly,
but by Englishmen instead of by foreigners. Where
a slothful race would have lain dormant and inactive, the
vigorous and adventurous islanders have even led the way in
two fields of literary endeavor, for fiction and the essay reached
their successive stages of growth more quickly in England
than elsewhere. Throughout poetry and prose, with but
few exceptions, there is a blend of shrewdness and inspiration
which in daily life is called common sense; Chaucer, Shakespeare,
Milton, Browning continually sound the practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>note, evincing their knowledge and appreciation of material
affairs. Another trait is that of searching out the moral
lessons in life and thought. "Books in the running brooks,
sermons in stones" are constantly sought by English
authors. Chaucer, Bunyan, Milton, Dickens, Carlyle, Browning,
and many others from the forefront of English letters
play the part of teacher and preacher again and again.</p>

historical developments. Longfellow, Emerson, Whitman,

many centuries, the arts in general, and literature especially,
did not begin to flourish to a noteworthy degree until the
eighteenth century. While Luther was the first great author

<p><b>Spanish Literature.</b> Marked by the dignity that is the
predominating characteristic of the nation. Just as Spain
has had but one brief period when she was supreme among
the European nations, so she has produced but one supreme
author, Cervantes. Her literature, for the most part, and
notably at the present day, is imitative, behind rather than
ahead of the times.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DIVISIONS_OF_LITERATURE" id="THE_DIVISIONS_OF_LITERATURE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE DIVISIONS OF LITERATURE</a></h3>


<p>Poetry, history, the novel, the short story, the essay,
and other branches of literature have all passed through
successive stages of change and progress. To trace one of
these divisions from its beginnings is not only interesting, but
affords an excellent method of study, easily carried out and
immediately beneficial. The novel of to-day, for example,
is the product of centuries of authorship, in which various
elements were gradually blended; the contributions of Cervantes,
Defoe, Addison, and Scott, extending over a space of
two hundred and thirty years, have each played a decisive
part in its formation. So it is with history, poetry, and the
rest of the forms of intellectual expression. The origin and
nature of each of these divisions is considered in the pages
that follow, with the usual lists and examples under each
heading.</p>


<h4 class="p1">POETRY</h4>

<p>How did poetry originate? In every nation the beginnings
of its literature have been poems. This highest form of
literary expression is also the oldest; it is not the final triumphant
product of a highly civilized age, after centuries
of slow development and gradual growth of power and art
in the use of words. It is exactly the opposite; the earliest
authors are the poets who sang and chanted the brave deeds
of the leaders of their nation; the "Iliad," the Norse sagas,
the "Song of Roland" are well-known examples of this primitive
yet glorious poetry. But why is this, that one of the
greatest of the arts should be already highly perfected in
barbaric times? Because poetry rests on two principles:
it is imaginative in its nature and rhythmic in its form. Man's
imagination stirred him to conquest for the sake of glory and
dominion, and then his imagination was again roused to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in words of splendid imagery of his honor and fame and
valor, of loveliness and happiness and power. Man's instinct
for the regular cadence that he heard in the tramp of
marching feet led him to chant aloud in firm, even measure
while the words he sang fitted themselves to the beat of his
music. It was only a slight matter to vary the length of
the lines or group them in stanzas or use rhyme in order to
increase the beauty of verse construction. However, the
true test of poetry has always been the value of its imaginative
power; no matter how accurate or elaborate its form, unless
it expresses great ideas it cannot rank as great poetry, but
merely as good verse. Like all art, poetry is the expression
of genuine feeling in beautiful form. (See Sidney's "Defense
of Poesy.")</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90 smcap">The Chief Divisions of Poetry</p>

<p><b>Epic poetry</b> tells the story of a great sequence of events,
such as the wanderings and home-coming of Odysseus, in
the "Odyssey." It is the earliest form of literature and one
of the grandest. No great period or nation has failed to
produce its epic.</p>

<p>For examples in Ancient Literature see "The Epic of
Pentaur" under Egyptian Literature; Homer; and Vergil.
The works of the last two are known as 'heroic epics.'</p>

<p>In the Dark Ages: "Beowulf" under Anglo-Saxon Literature;
"The Song of Roland" under French Literature;
"The Nibelungenlied" under German Literature; "The
Saga of Eric the Red" under Norse Literature; and "The
Chronicle of the Cid" under Spanish Literature.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages: Dante and Tasso, who wrote 'sacred
epics.' The "Old English Ballads" are excellent examples of
the shorter poetic tales from which such epics as the "Iliad,"
the "Nibelungenlied," and the "Song of Roland" were
built up.</p>

<p>In the Renaissance: Spenser, whose "Faerie Queene"
is an epic of chivalry. Milton's great epics of "Paradise
Lost" and "Paradise Regained" are sacred epics, reflecting
the Puritan influence that came over England at the close of
the period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Age of Classicism: the mock-epic of Pope's "Rape
of the Lock," and the epic tale in prose, "Telemachus," by
Fénelon.</p>

<p>In the Age of Romanticism: Scott's "Lady of the Lake,"
and Byron's "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," although this
last is perhaps best regarded as a study of the poet's emotions
upon visiting the grandest scenes in Europe.</p>

<p>In Nineteenth Century Literature: Longfellow's "Evangeline"
and "Hiawatha" are short epics. Owing to the central,
unifying figure of King Arthur, Tennyson's "Idylls of the
King" have much of the epic effect.</p>

<p><b>Lyric poetry</b> includes all verse that presents the poet's
feelings and passions; it is characterized also by plentiful
use of varied ideas, rich and fanciful imagery, and rhythmical
flow of language.</p>

<p>From the beginning there were shorter songs, as well as the
epic, often accompanied on the lyre, a small harp, from which
this branch of poetry takes its name. To-day lyric poetry
tends toward a lighter tone and spirit than in the Romantic
Period; in length it may vary very widely, from the little
quatrain, of four lines, to an ode or a ballad of almost epic
extent. Burns, Milton, Moore, Byron, Keats, Shelley, Shakespeare,
and Wordsworth are among the foremost in this field;
among the ancients Catullus, Horace, and Sappho are prominent;
while the writings of Goethe, Heine, Uhland, Longfellow,
Whittier, Browning, Tennyson, and Swinburne contain
many that are familiar. Musical accompaniment is no
longer essential. There are several forms of the lyric, chief
among which are the following:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>The Ode, addressed to a person or a personified idea or
else expressing the poet's emotions at a moment of great
exaltation. In form it either follows a varying sequence
of lines of irregular length or else employs a series of uniform
stanzas. Illustrative of the former are Dryden's "Alexander's
Feast" and "A Song for St. Cecilia's Day," and
Wordsworth's "Ode on Intimations of Immortality";
among the latter are Collins's "Ode to Evening," Keats's
"Ode to a Nightingale" and "Ode on a Grecian Urn,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" and "To a Skylark,"
and Wordsworth's "To the Cuckoo" and "Ode to Duty."</p>

<p>The Sonnet, of Italian origin, was brought to its perfection
by Petrarch; it consists of fourteen lines of equal
length (in English usually of ten syllables), the first eight
lines constituting the <em>octave</em> and the last six, the <em>sestet</em>.
In the octave the rhymes are arranged <em>a b b a a b b a</em>, and
in the sestet, either <em>c d c d c d</em> or <em>c d e c d e</em>. The sonnet
should contain one idea, which may be treated from two
points of view, in the octave and sestet respectively. As
used by Milton and later poets in England this double
treatment was not often observed and there is no break
of thought at the end of the octave. Owing to its restrictions
the sonnet is considered one of the most difficult forms
in which to achieve distinction, as metrical ingenuity without
sublimity of thought bars mere versifiers. The most
noted examples by English authors are E. B. Browning's
"Sonnets from the Portuguese," Keats's "On First Looking
into Chapman's Homer," Milton's "On His Blindness,"
Shelley's "England in 1819," and those selected from
Wordsworth.</p>

<p>The Ballad, partaking somewhat of the epic, is a tale in
verse, usually arranged in short stanzas. "Old English
Ballads," Cowper's "The Diverting History of John Gilpin,"
Drayton's "Ballad of Agincourt," and Rossetti's
"The White Ship" are specimens of this form. It originated
among the peasantry, who commemorated the prowess
of their favorite heroes in rough verse sung by the cottage
hearth.</p>

<p>The Elegy is devoted to the memory of the dead and
therefore is grave and stately in its metrical form as well
as in thought. Gray's "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,"
Milton's "Lycidas," Shelley's "Adonais," and
Tennyson's "In Memoriam" are the most famous.</p></div>

<p><b>Idyllic poetry</b> briefly presents a picture, complete and lovely,
usually pastoral and romantic. Tennyson's "Idylls of the
King," Goldsmith's "Deserted Village," the Idylls of Theocritus,
and the Eclogues of Vergil are the best examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Dramatic poetry</b>, in which the form of a play or drama is
used, has always been chosen for the deepest and most majestic
presentations of the problems and wonders of human life.
The dramatic poets of the ancients as well as those of modern
times rank among the most far-seeing thinkers and ablest
writers of the world. No philosopher or historian has ever
been able to reach the people or express the profoundest
reflections so readily and forcibly.</p>

<p>The tragedies of Æschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles, with
those of Shakespeare and the "Faust" of Goethe, are the
highest achievements in literature; their effect, from the
stage, is instantaneous, and even in reading them the mind
receives a direct impression of wonder and awe not elsewhere
given. The Greek tragedies mentioned above have for
their underlying theme the power of relentless fate, the
inevitable omnipotence of right, and the final destruction of
wrong and falsehood. In these and "Macbeth," "Hamlet,"
and "King Lear" the mastery of plot and action is superb;
the play gathers force and momentum until the catastrophe
sweeps down upon the evil-doers and unfortunates like a tidal
wave. Yet each step in its progress, even the least trifle,
is so natural as to seem unavoidable. Here is the proof of
the poet's genius, in that he selects the message to be presented
to his audience or readers, chooses his characters,
and outlines his plot, then combines the three elements with
such skill and with such inspiration as to leave an effect of
perfect truth and actuality. Aristotle, the ancient philosopher
and critic, declared that the very souls of the audience were
cleansed and rid of pettiness and self-seeking by beholding
such works as these; that the spectacle of disaster brought
down upon men by their own vanity and wrong-doing, and
portrayed in language of such vivid grandeur, was the most
impressive means of reaching the hearts of men.</p>

<p>In addition to the authors mentioned above, Calderon,
Jonson, Lessing, Marlowe, Molière, Racine, Rostand, and
Schiller have made notable contributions to the poetic drama.
(See also <a href="#DRAMA">Drama, p. 49.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="p1">FICTION</h4>

<p>The practice of telling tales of love and heroism is older than
history itself. Ever since men sat about the fire of an evening
and recited the deeds of their chieftains or extolled the
beauty of their princesses, in other words, ever since the days
when poetry first began, stories and tales have been handed
down, first by word of mouth, then by carvings and inscriptions
and at last by writing and printing. The first fiction
was a simple, imaginative invention of adventure, told to
pass the time. Æsop's "Fables" and Apuleius's "Story
of Cupid and Psyche," ancient as they are, show the progress
already made in the art of narration, the one simple and
insistent in its purpose of teaching common sense by whimsical
anecdotes, the other a delicately artistic legend told with
exquisite grace. In "Jewish Literature" the story of Tobit's
wonderful adventures at once calls to mind the "Arabian
Nights," which were of similar origin, told by professional
story-tellers for centuries before they were finally written down
and translated for our perpetual delight.</p>

<p><b>The novel</b>, a new feature in fiction, shows its first faint
beginnings in the tumult and enthusiasm of the Renaissance,
that strenuous age of new ideas and discoveries. Cervantes
in writing "Don Quixote" had a definite purpose in mind
beyond mere entertainment; the passing of the age of chivalry
and the pathos and humor of life form the true subject of his
tale. Bunyan in the "Pilgrim's Progress" shows the same
intent of doing something more than providing interesting
reading; the growth of a noble character through struggle
and temptation on the journey through life is the central
thought of his work. His hero, Christian, changes in character,
becoming a stronger, better man as the story goes on.
Defoe's Robinson Crusoe goes through much of the same
evolution. And this is the underlying principle of the novel,
that it has a purpose beyond simple story-telling, possessing
a plot or unified succession of incidents, with actors whose
characters develop. It is a picture of human life, with
strength and weakness, happiness and misery, all bound together
and forming a united and well-proportioned whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>However, it was not until Addison and Steele, in the "Spectator"
essays, had shown such skill in drawing characters and
depicting manners and customs that the time was ripe for the
true novel to appear. For one of the chief duties of the novel
is to criticize life, to furnish comment on the social conditions
and tendencies of the day. Among the earliest and also
the greatest of the English novelists, Fielding, whose work
appeared about thirty years after the "Spectator," not only
draws sturdy and truthful pictures of the life of his day, but
also makes the reader see the true value of that life and estimate
its good and its bad qualities. In the same way Dickens
and Thackeray, not very long after, supplied unending amusement
and fun for the world and at the same time did far more
by making the nations sit up and think, pointing out with
almost brutal clearness the need of unselfish action and the
love of truth and simplicity. There is not a novel of high
rank but contains more than meets the eye at first glance.
It is the readiest means of putting a critical estimate of
history, of life and society, directly before the world.</p>

<p><b>The short story</b>, as distinct from a story that is short, is a
nineteenth-century development in fiction. During the last
hundred years the magazines grew so rapidly in numbers and
circulation that they could not depend entirely on continued
stories; they had to have tales that would be complete in
one number, which could be read at one sitting. The demand
brought the needed solution, a story which instead of length,
with intricate action and complex studies of personality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
supplied rapid action, brilliantly imaginative description,
and a terse portrayal of character. Scenes, persons, and
events were stamped immediately on the reader's mind; the
effect desired by the writer was attained by force and bold
decision. Edgar Allan Poe was one of the first to excel in
this field, utilizing his critical powers as well as sheer inspiration
to meet the situation.</p>

<p>The variations in style and manner are as manifold in the
short story as in the novel. Boccaccio, "The Arabian
Nights," French Literature, and the "Gesta Romanorum"
show the work of the Middle Ages, from mere anecdote with
a moral tagged on, in the "Gesta," to the graceful prose poem
of "Aucassin and Nicolete." Barrie, Brown, and Hawthorne
do little more than draw quiet sketches of simple life, while
Björnson, Eliot, Hardy, Harte, Irving, Kipling, Macleod,
Maupassant, Stevenson, and Tolstoi deal powerfully with
situations that bring home to us the force of fate which lurks
hidden in petty incidents. Aldrich, Collins, Crawford, Hale,
and Watson have all used this type of fiction effectively.
Indeed, Hale's "Man Without a Country" drives home the
idea of patriotism so vigorously that Italy recently issued a
translation in an edition of a million copies for distribution
to her army.</p>


<h4 class="p1">HISTORY</h4>

<p>Like poetry and fiction, history emerges from the darkness
of the unknown ages, at first no more than a boastful record
of slaughter and usurpation, such as shows through the gloss
and splendor of epic poetry. The sagas in "Norse Literature,"
the crisp record of invasion and conquest by Cæsar,
and that of Josephus on the Roman conquest of the Jews
are all of this type, a chronicle by an eyewitness of the succession
of deeds that made up some event in a nation's life.</p>

<p>An improvement came with Herodotus in ancient times and
again with Froissart in the Middle Ages. Both of these
historians added zest to their tale by including some account
of the principal personages as well as picturesque, well-drawn
pictures of the scene. In other words, they filled in the background
of their pictures, their wars were waged by people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
with definite personalities and in a country with certain individual
features and peculiarities.</p>

<p>From this method to the modern scientific style was a further
advance. It is now understood that we must perceive
the growth of a nation, its social changes, its increase of
intellectual as well as physical power, its innermost secrets
of success or failure. Thucydides, the Greek historian, and
Tacitus, the Roman, felt something of this and have left us
far more than a mere list of battles and rulers. Gibbon, in
"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," and later
still, Guizot, Mommsen, and Ferrero, have carried on the
work of analyzing the complex mysteries of history and
civilization and have brought it to its highest development.
The more stirring visions of heroism and kingly dominion
have been replaced by pages in which not an emperor but a
nation is born, passes through childhood to maturity and
wisdom, succumbs to disease or an enemy's murderous attacks,
and perishes.</p>

<p>The study of history nowadays may involve the scholar in
years of drudgery, such as searching out and listing the exports
and imports of the city of London between the years
1340 and 1400. However, the conclusions drawn from his
discoveries may be of world-wide importance. The questions
of tariff reform, wage-scales, taxation, and representative
government will all be affected by the data which his
scientific investigation will have brought to light. Those of
us whose life-work lies in other directions can give no attention
to the details of toilsome labor like this. But the results
must always be significant for us. The great movements in
the troublous advance of the nations from barbarism to
civilization are full of lessons which we must learn. History,
regarded as a series of wars, an unceasing fury of bloodshed
and misgovernment, is of slight interest to peace-loving people.
But history as a series of pictures, showing the conditions of
life in various ages and countries, picturing the spread of
liberty and equality, and the slow yet sure increase of justice&mdash;history
viewed in this manner is one of the most stirring and
educative subjects for reading and study.</p>

<p>How was the Roman Empire built up? What was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
condition of the people in the days of Homer? How did the
ancient tribes live from which the German nation is descended?
What was England like in Shakespeare's time?
These are some of the questions which we should ask. Many
of the ablest brains in Europe and America have spent their
lives in finding out the answers.</p>

<h4 class="p1">BIOGRAPHY</h4>

<p>The lives of great men have always been of interest not
merely for the sake of satisfying curiosity, but because of the
value of further knowledge about their habits, thoughts, and
actions. The personality of a great man attracts us; perhaps
through reading an intimate account of his life we may see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
into the reasons for his superiority, possibly we may find the
key to the secret of power. So much can be learned from
biography that it seems absurd how little importance is given
to the subject even in our best colleges. Yet Christianity
rests upon the life and teachings of one Personality, nation
after nation has been saved or ruined by the deeds of one
individual, wisdom and contentment have been found by
the great minds of the world. By considering their lives,
their principles, their virtues, and their failings we can get
an extraordinary insight into the problems of happiness and
wholesome living. Carlyle rightly called a Great Man "the
most precious gift that Heaven can give to the Earth; a
man of 'genius' as we call it; the Soul of a Man actually
sent down from the skies with a God's-message to us." To
see such a man at his work, at his play, thinking, dreaming,
attaining greatness little by little or in a flash, to spend hours
with him in thought, learning from him or from his friends
and critics wherein he proved his power and how he labored
to express it: to be in such close touch with one of the giants
of the earth is a privilege which we must not dare to neglect.
The opportunity is ours, ours be the blame and the failure if
we neglect it.</p>

<h4 class="p1">ESSAY</h4>

<p>Originally intended, as its name implies, to be a tentative
effort rather than a finished production, the essay has none
the less become one of the most perfect forms of prose. Its
subject and the treatment thereof may be of almost any nature,
provided it is well wrought and finished in style; for an essay
is the artistic consideration of a topic, often critical, as in the
case of Matthew Arnold's masterpieces, humorous, as with
Lamb, philosophical as with Emerson, Carlyle, and Ruskin,
and so on through a dozen diverse manners. In general the
essay is brief, critical, and scholarly, and bears the stamp of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the author's personality and individual opinion in his most
polished style.</p>

<p>Bacon and Montaigne were the first to use it, Milton
followed, and then Addison and Steele brought it to a high
state of light and pungent perfection. Lamb, Macaulay,
and Stevenson are perhaps the leaders in its later development.
The work of such writers as Walton and Gilbert White,
though not perhaps within the stricter limits of the definition,
is closely related to the essay in tone and style.</p>

<h4 class="p1">HUMOR</h4>

<p>Humor is the most subtle of intellectual modes of expression.
To define it and lay down its laws and principles is
all but beyond human power. For it ranges from the inspired
nonsense of Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" and
"Through the Looking-Glass" or the rough and ready
gusto of Browne's "Showman's Courtship" to the airily
intangible delicacy of Lamb's "Essays of Elia" and the
venomous sarcasm of Swift's "Gulliver's Travels." Mere
wit turns on an absurd similarity in words or ideas, as in
Hood's lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"They went and told the sexton, and</p>
<p class="verse4">The sexton tolled the bell."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Yet the deepest humor is all but pathos; Don Quixote's
demented visions of giants that prove to be windmills and of
castles that turn out to be taverns provoke our laughter
while they stir our pity.</p>

<p>Humor would seem to depend, according to some, upon the
association of ideas or circumstances that have no true relation
to each other, as if they actually possessed a natural
relationship. For this reason a cat or a cow dressed in coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and trousers provokes laughter, or a village bully described
as a proud monarch causes a smile. An unexpected answer
made as seriously as if it were appropriate is one of the commoner
examples of the ludicrous. It is much for the same
reason that actual misfortune may appear laughable, if the
element of suffering is suppressed, as in Joel Chandler Harris's
"Uncle Remus" stories, or Gilbert's "Yarn of the Nancy
Bell." Its very <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sublety'">subtlety</ins> limits the appeal of humor. "One
man's meat is another man's poison" applies more closely to
this division of authorship than to any other. What tickles
the fancy of one person, and more especially, one nation,
may not afford even passing amusement to another. Englishmen
find our comic papers dull, while many Americans see
little to laugh at in "Punch."</p>

<h4 class="p1">FOR THE CHILDREN</h4>

<p>The foundations of good taste are best laid in childhood.
Fairy tales, adventures, and all sorts of stories for children
may be well designed and well written, or the opposite, just
as much as books for older people. Choose your children's
books as you choose their food; take care they get no trash,
arrange a tempting diet of wholesome nourishment for their
minds. The authors listed below wrote as carefully and
thoughtfully for little folks as when they wrote for grown-ups.
Andersen devoted his life to authorship for children; the
Grimm brothers made a scientific study of folk-lore and fairy
tales throughout the German empire, collecting the stories
told by the firesides in each district. Carroll, Hawthorne,
Kingsley, and many others put their best efforts into books
which are unquestioned examples of great literature and yet
were purposed entirely for youth. There is no occasion for
young people to ruin their taste and their appreciation with
ill-written rubbish.</p>

<h4 class="p1">TRAVEL</h4>

<p>The majority of travelers have been men of action rather
than words, filled with enthusiasm and inspiration for deeds
instead of books. Columbus, Magellan, Drake, and the
rest of the leaders of exploration have left nothing that can
be called literature. Their records, at best, are scientific
reports of their discoveries. Still, ever since the days when
Pausanias made his remarkable tour of Greece and described
its wonders and Herodotus jotted down the travelers' tales
of Egypt, there have been able writers to tell of the marvels,
real or imaginary, to be found in foreign lands.</p>

<h4 class="p1"><a name="DRAMA" id="DRAMA"></a>DRAMA</h4>

<p>In both ancient and modern literature the drama is of religious
origin. Among the Greeks it began as a service in
memory of some dead hero, the choir or chorus chanting the
story of his life and deeds. Their leader presently began to
take an actor's part, addressing the audience or congregation,
and then other persons were introduced who carried
on a dialogue with him and at last played the part of characters
in the hero's history. In the Middle Ages, when the
great majority of the people could not read, the Bible story
was acted at Christmas, Easter, and other festivals in order
to impress it on their minds more vividly. From this it was
an easy step to the presentation of historical events, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was but one more step to the modern drama's elaborate staging
and well-rounded plot. (For the poetic drama, see <a href="#Page_40">p. 40.</a>)</p>

<p>In general the drama has certain limitations which must be
taken into account before passing judgment upon a play.
Three hours is the utmost duration for a play; it must
'get across' within that period, since an audience becomes
wearied during the third hour. It appeals to two senses, hearing
and sight, while other forms of literature appeal but to
one. This is an advantage as far as it enables the dramatist
to tell his story by scenery and action as well as by speech and
incidental music. It is a handicap when the action or the
scenery is faulty and distracts the attention of the audience
from the dialogue. Descriptions of any length, the study or
analysis of personality, all features of ordinary fiction which
delay the action are impossible on the stage. Speech and
action must be fitted together so as to carry the plot through
without pause, revealing the story forcibly, clearly, and
yet naturally, within the restricted time.</p>

<p>These limitations have been handled in widely varying
manners: three systems of presentation have been employed,
the ancient, the medieval, and the modern, all of which are to
be seen at the present day, thanks to the revival of Greek plays
in the stadiums and amphitheaters of our colleges and likewise
to the revival of the Elizabethan drama during the past
ten years.</p>

<p>The ancient or Greek drama was presented in a stone
amphitheater against a background of marble, constructed
in the form of a palace or temple; the semicircular space
occupied by the orchestra seats in our theaters contained an
altar in the center and was used by the actors as a part of the
stage; the chorus in particular used this space for their
stately dances and stood at one side during the progress of
the action, commenting on the course of events in odes which
they chanted. The lack of movable scenery, and other
limitations, resulted in the restrictions known as <b>the three
'unities,'</b> of action, time, and place. No play, according to
<b>the unity of action</b>, should introduce incidents that were not
a part of the main action; the plot must be absolutely simple.
Thus the story of Jessica and Lorenzo, in "The Merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of Venice" would be barred by this convention, as it does
not contribute to the development of the main story of
Antonio and Shylock. The <b>unity of time</b> required that the
action should not represent the occurrences of more than a
day at the very outside, and the <b>unity of place</b> held the action
to one spot. These latter conventions were to increase the
impression of truth and actuality on the minds of the spectators,
heightening the effect of complete naturalness and
leaving their imaginations free to grasp the problems of the
plot without the additional effort of supposing lapses of time
and changes of scene to have occurred. The number of
actors was small; usually two, or at most three, were permitted
to take part at one time in a portion of the dialogue. These
conventions produce a simplicity that was not bare and
dull, but just the reverse; the attention is focused directly
upon the leading character and his fate from beginning to
end. The effect is single and direct, there is no complexity
or intricacy to puzzle the audience or distract its interest in
the crisis which is so obviously approaching. The grandeur
of this type of drama is like that of a great hymn, such as
"Old Hundred," sung by a vast congregation.</p>

<p>The medieval plays, which reached their height in Shakespeare's
time, were very different from those of the ancients.
The stage was almost as bare and scenery was not used, but
changes of locality were frequent, indicated by hanging out
a sign with the words, "This is a garden" or "A Street in
Venice" and so on. In the same way there was no restriction
upon time; years might be supposed to have passed
between one act and the next. The imagination of the
audience was expected to take care of such matters, and indeed
it did so with the utmost ease. The plot could be
supplemented with all sorts of incidents whether they directly
concerned it or not. For example, the wrestling scene at the
beginning of "As You Like It" was inserted to satisfy the
Elizabethan love of sport, not because it could be of use in
advancing the progress of the story, as it did nothing of the
kind. The Greek unities were disregarded completely; however,
the most impressive of Shakespeare's tragedies do
adhere to the principle of the unity of action,&mdash;"Macbeth,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
for example, deals with the consequences of unscrupulous ambition,
each event in the play leads directly on to the catastrophe
without a pause, there are no minor events or plots.</p>

<p>The modern play differs from both the earlier forms of the
drama in its appeal to the eye. The use of scenery, which
came in at the beginning of the Age of Classicism, has led to
an elaboration of stage effects which sometimes is injurious
to the success of a production. Much of the modern stage-craft
is concerned with scenic effects and therefore does not
come into this discussion. The chief distinction to-day lies
in the treatment of problems of everyday life in an everyday
manner. Neither the ancient nor the Shakespearian playwrights
handled tragedy in the setting of ordinary life. The
Greeks portrayed famous heroes and princes and so did the
Elizabethans, but rarely, except in comedy, was there any
presentation of the life of the middle classes of that time.
Sheridan and Ibsen, in common with most of the modern
playwrights, take the life of the mass of the people and draw
their illustrations of success and failure direct. The audience
of to-day sees itself walking and talking on the stage, playing
the fool or the hero.</p>

<p>Each style has its merits and its faults, each is powerful
in the hands of a genius and each fails when used by incompetents.
The average drama depends largely upon the actors
for its success, it can hardly be classed among literary efforts.
Only the plays wrought by masters of thought as well as of
speech can be given a place in the realm of literature.</p>

<h4 class="p1">ORATORY</h4>

<p>The art of addressing a large gathering and winning their
support, as well as their attention, by sound argument and
also by eloquence is a study that is in danger of falling into
a decline, owing perhaps to the prevalence of newspapers
and the rapidity with which an argument or an idea can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
spread broadcast over the world by the telegraph and the
press. In reading even the finest speeches of the past or the
present allowance must almost always be made for the personal
magnetism of the speaker, the appeal made by his
presence, his gestures, and his voice. For this reason it is
difficult to form a just estimate of the worth of a speech,
especially at a date when the subject has become less vital
or even unfamiliar through the passage of time. The sole
bases of criticism under these conditions must be the force of
the argument and the eloquence of the style. This is aptly
illustrated in the case of Burke, whose arguments were admitted
to be irresistible in their strength, but who had so poor a delivery
that he was called the dinner-bell of the House of Commons,
in reference to the departure of the members when he
rose to speak. The most influential speakers have been those
who combined skill in argument with grace and eloquence
and reinforced these qualities with a commanding personality.
These talents are needed to-day if we are to maintain the
standard set by Washington, Webster, and Lincoln.</p>

<h4 class="p1">PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE</h4>

<p>The aim of philosophy, like that of science, is to probe the
mystery of life, to discover as far as possible the nature of
man and of the universe in which he dwells. These efforts
began when men first asked "What am I? What is this
world?" Philosophy attempts the answer by reasoning and
meditation, while science uses inventions, such as the telescope,
mathematical calculation, and all other means of obtaining
accurate information regarding the physical environment
and nature of man. The former is concerned with the
spirit, the unseen, the motives of honor, love, and the like,
and the infinite possibilities of the mind and the soul; the
latter deals with the actual, material conditions of life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>

<h3><a name="FROM_SEVEN_TO_TWENTY-ONE" id="FROM_SEVEN_TO_TWENTY-ONE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">FROM SEVEN TO TWENTY-ONE</a></h3>

<p class="center bold">Lists of readings for young and old.</p>

<p class="center bold">Showing how to acquire, by easy stages, a knowledge of the
best in literature, year by year.</p>


<p>Unlike poets, painters, and the rest of the world of artists,
booklovers are made, not born. But many a booklover has
been spoiled in the making, too; so that we must needs give
thought to the process of transforming everyday folk into
<em>willing and skilful readers and lovers of books</em>. Many boys
and girls and many men and women have lost all interest
in the realm of books through lack of suitable material for
enjoyment and adequate opportunity for practice. What
books they could find round the house failed to meet their
desires or hold their attention; probably they were technical
or 'dry-as-dust.'</p>

<p>In other words the untrained reader, whether young or old,
must be trained and exercised on the right books at the right
time. Not that he should be coaxed and tempted with light
fiction or showy trash, quite the contrary; he must acquire
<em>strength of mind and intellectual habits</em>&mdash;he is to be trained
to grasp serious thought as well as highstrung romance.
Conan Doyle's thrilling "White Company" or Blackmore's
tender "Lorna Doone" form excellent entertainment, but
they must be supplemented by sturdy common sense, such
as one finds in Franklin's "Autobiography," Dana's "Two
Years Before the Mast," or Bancroft's account of the Lexington
and Concord fight. The young mind, and the old one
as well, cannot grow strong and able without exercise. Just
as tennis, football, swimming, or golf help to develop and
strengthen our physical powers, so the mind likewise must
take exercise that will ripen and enlarge the intellectual
powers. The joy of living is dependent upon full vigor of
brain and brawn; the weakling, whether in intellect or in
muscle, loses the best that life has to give. Our ideal must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54b" id="Page_54b">[54b]</a></span>
be not merely a sound mind in a sound body but, rather,
a strong mind in a strong body.</p>

<p>The lists that follow have been devised to meet the requirements
for training the mind to a ready facility and
enjoyment of books and reading. Naturally, these groups
are arbitrary, they definitely place one author or selection
in the eleven year old's list, another in the fifteen; whereas
either might well be transferred, in individual cases. The
object manifestly is to group writers and selections as a
means of guidance and help to the average reader whether
parent or child, but not to draw hard and fast lines. The
sooner the reader becomes ready to wander as he will, the
sooner will he be a true booklover.</p>

<p><b>Seven to Ten Years of Age.</b> At this time of life, as every
one knows, fairy tales are an unfailing delight and form the
foundations, moreover, of all thorough literary appreciation.
In addition to these, tales of adventure or of travel, such as
Malory's Morte Darthur, or Marco Polo's astonishing discoveries
in China, serve as admirable supplementary reading
at this age.</p>

<p><b>Eleven and Twelve Years of Age.</b> The next step consists
in awakening the sense of understanding, rousing the mind
to grasp actual scenes and situations. For this purpose the
"Pilgrim's Progress," "Two Years Before the Mast," "The
Village Blacksmith," or "Horatius" are especially suitable.
For while the fairy tale element is continued in "Cupid and
Psyche," the "Odyssey," and "Undine," it is to these more
realistic selections that we must look for the stimulus to
imaginative growth that the children need. For this reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54c" id="Page_54c">[54c]</a></span>
"Robinson Crusoe" is of paramount value at this time
simply because it trains the young mind to picture the scenes
or events with the utmost care for details; probably no other
work of fiction in English Literature can equal it for realistic
vividness and precision.</p>

<p><b>Thirteen and Fourteen Years of Age.</b> This period should
mark the beginning of true reading power&mdash;the faculty of
perceiving and absorbing the pictures, the facts, the ideas
that lie within the printed page. The true joys of reading
first-class fiction, for example, "Don Quixote" or "The
Cloister and the Hearth," are usually first experienced in
these years. And in the same manner young readers delight
in the more vivid pages of history, such as "The Relief of
Leyden," or "The Conquest of Peru," or&mdash;best of all&mdash;Raleigh's
telling account of the fight of the 'Revenge' to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54d" id="Page_54d">[54d]</a></span>gether
with Tennyson's magnificent poem, built up from the
prose of Raleigh. For it is in such passages as these that the
natural tendency to hero-worship is roused and fostered.
Jim Bludso, Sir Launfal, Alexander the Great, John Halifax,
Lorna Doone, and Constantia, together with the splendid
characters in the works already mentioned, all establish in
the minds of the average boy and girl examples of courage,
courtesy, and nobility that are never forgotten.</p>

<p><b>Fifteen and Sixteen Years of Age.</b> The appreciation of
poetry is one of the most subtle and difficult developments
in the youthful intellect. Yet some enjoyment of poetry,
not merely narrative poems, but contemplative verse as well,
should manifest itself during these next years. Furthermore,
it is high time to form an acquaintance with writers who will
be met again and again in days yet to come. No one will
maintain for a moment that a sixteen year old lad will fully
understand and appreciate Milton's "L'Allegro," with its
treasury of allusion; yet, on the other hand, no one will
pretend that this same lad should not at least be granted the
opportunity to listen for the first time to those immortal
lines. For this reason not only Milton, but Lincoln, Cowper,
Pepys, Tolstoi, Hodgkin, Gray, and several others are included
in the list.</p>

<p>But apart from the more serious and contemplative side
of the reading that can be commenced at this age, there is
much that will fascinate and delight those who are looking
for pastime rather than deep thinking. Barham's "Ingoldsby
Legends," of which "The Knight and the Lady" is
a most characteristic tale in verse, have long been the joy of
all who love laughter and nonsense; and so with Irving's
"Knickerbocker's New York," which in many respects is
unequaled for wit and delicate fun. Crawford's "The Upper
Berth," Doyle's "White Company," and Dumas's "Three
Musketeers" furnish thrill enough for the most eager adventure
seeker. Tolstoi and Goldsmith will satisfy a quieter
mood with their gentle satire on the folly and stupidity and
vanity of everyday people, who none the less are the salt
of the earth, after all.</p>

<p><b>Seventeen and Eighteen Years of Age.</b> With increasing
maturity we may naturally expect the mind to enjoy the
more calm and meditative moods of life: for example, the
essays of Addison and Lamb, the more forceful historical
reflections of such writers as Green, Froissart, and Parkman,
the "Utopia" of Sir Thomas More, Thoreau's "Walden,"
and Washington's "Farewell Address." These form an excellent
introduction to the deeper thoughts which will shortly
be forced upon youth as it goes out into the world to fight
for a career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54g" id="Page_54g">[54g]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time, too, interest is stirred to attempt an understanding
of the 'reason for things'&mdash;the mind endeavors
to arrive at some law or principle beneath the varied course
of life and action in the world. In other words, boyhood
and girlhood are past, and an older view of life and its responsibilities
must naturally take the place of the carefree
spirit of earlier days. The qualities of friendship that appear
in "Tennessee's Partner" and the search for spiritual as
well as intellectual companionship and understanding that
is emphasized in Tennyson or Matthew Arnold are at this
time beginning to be more fully appreciated and understood.</p>

<p><b>Nineteen and Twenty Years of Age.</b> Unquestionably, as
the years pass on, we read again the books that have already
given us so many hours of happiness and amusement. For
this reason it is well for the young booklover to return to
the lists for the previous years and renew acquaintanceships
there. No doubt some of the authors whom he found but
moderately amusing then will now win far more favor in his
sight. Meanwhile, among the fresh material history and
criticism naturally find a prominent place. Mommsen's
estimate of Julius Cæsar and Chesterton's appreciative
critique of Dickens stand among the foremost studies of
great men that the world has yet produced. In the field of
poetry it is high time to spend some quiet hours with Emerson,
Browning, Shakespeare, Shelley, and Wordsworth. These
five poets represent perhaps the very best that English verse
has produced in the way of meditation&mdash;insight into the
depths of nature and humanity.</p>

<p>At this point the reader will do well to consider other
chapters in this Handbook, notably that on Literary Criticism,
and the rest of Part II, which deals with the general principles
underlying a fuller comprehension of literature. Part III,
Studies of Great Authors, will be of even greater help to
those readers who are finding increased pleasure in reading
as students rather than for the sake of recreation or light
reading alone. By following out the lines of thought presented
in Parts II and III, especially if one does not attempt
to carry too heavy a quantity of reading at a time, the enjoyment
of books and thought will be immensely stimulated
and broadened.</p>

<p><b>Twenty-one and After.</b> During these years, through respect
for wisdom and experience, maturity rapidly quickens into
being. Once we get a few hard knocks in the battle of life,
our regard for the learning and understanding of our elders
soon increases. We likewise can enter more thoroughly into
the work of such thinkers as Carlyle, Galton, Emerson,
Ruskin, Shaler, or of such poets as Chaucer and Goethe.
For these men have spent the best of their lives in studying
and probing into the causes and developments of our moods
and characters. Carlyle has given us the most terrific and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54j" id="Page_54j">[54j]</a></span>
stirring account ever written of the battle that is waged in
every man's soul between the forces of good and evil. Goethe
has dramatized this same problem, revealing the wretchedness
of him who only thinks of self, who drags his nearest and
dearest down to ruin simply to gratify his lusts or his whims.
Ruskin searches architecture, painting, or even the workmanship
of everyday trades in order to discover their true
merit&mdash;their greatness and their weakness. From such
writings we can learn more and yet more each time we peruse
them. There is no end to the richness and wealth of thought
and experience to be gained from these alone.</p>

<p>Apart from the power to appreciate the thought itself,
the reader by this time is surely ready to take pleasure in
the style of such writers as Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
Matthew Arnold, Walter Pater, Herrick, and Spenser. And
with respect to the matter, he surely will profit in the company
of Sir Thomas Browne, Thomas à Kempis, Mill, and
Plato, presenting four remarkably valuable points of view
in their studies of what is most worth man's consideration.
Further reading of interest in style and in matter will be
found under the headings of "Essay," "Travel," "Drama,"
"Oratory," "Philosophy," etc., on pages 46-53 of this Handbook.</p>

<p>One of the chief problems of the reader deals with the question
of foreign authors. Perhaps one man in a hundred
thousand can find time to learn to read more than four languages
fluently. If he is to get in touch with the great writers
of other tongues than those which he knows, he must perforce
read translations. And for most of us translations are
the only resource. The modern writers have been translated
with but slight difficulty, mainly because their views of life
are so closely akin to ours that their thoughts may be put
into English with slight trouble. But the ancients, the
masters of Greek and Roman Literature, regarded life from
other standpoints than ours. They were mainly interested
in interpreting fate and the mysteries of life. Their work,
then, is for the most part philosophic, even when presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54l" id="Page_54l">[54l]</a></span>
in the form of drama or of poetry. It is so great, so lofty in
tone and so profound in its perception of everlasting truths
that we cannot afford to neglect it. But it can only be
grasped by a mature mind and by calm and patient meditation.
The tragedies of Æschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles,
the poetry of Lucretius and Cleanthes, and the meditations
of Marcus Aurelius rank among the grandest and most sublime
works that mortal mind has ever achieved. For complete
lists of foreign authors, see the classified entries on pages
28-35 of this Handbook.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_INDEX_AND_THE_BIOGRAPHICAL" id="THE_INDEX_AND_THE_BIOGRAPHICAL"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE INDEX AND THE BIOGRAPHICAL
SKETCHES</a></h3>


<p><b>The Use of the Index.</b> The thoughtful and habitual use
of the Index will prove of more lasting benefit than any other
practice associated with reading. Not only is attention called
to authors, to the titles of selections, and to the opening lines
of familiar and unfamiliar poems, but hundreds upon hundreds
of topics are there listed, dealing with subjects of endless
variety as viewed by the ablest minds of the past and the
present. Agriculture, for example, is dealt with by ancients
and moderns&mdash;among others, by Cicero and by Charles
Dudley Warner. America's development, we find, has been
presented from such diverse viewpoints as those of Ferrero,
the modern Italian historian; of Goethe, the master-poet of
old Germany, as bitter a foe of Prussia as any who live to-day;
of Hamilton, the statesman-economist; of McMaster, the
historian; of Henry, the patriot orator; of Leslie Stephen, the
English critic, and other leaders of the world's thought. The
value of books, the use of chariots of war, the case for and
against Charles I of England, the nature of conversation, the
progress of the drama in ancient and in more recent times&mdash;these
topics suggest the amazing diversity of outlook.</p>

<p>Whether for the sake of study or merely as a pastime,
every moment employed upon the Index will prove stimulating,
will open trains of thought and furnish additional
means of enjoyment that otherwise will lie undiscovered.</p>

<p>These fifty pages provide an encyclopedia of intellectual
entertainment and cultivation. Through them the reader
can pursue a subject or a line of thought as nowhere else.
Not the opinion of one man, or of one nation, or of one era
alone, but the best and most valued reflections of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54n" id="Page_54n">[54n]</a></span>
men of all the ages are here collected under every important
heading on which they best expressed themselves.</p>

<p>Throughout this whole work, Opportunity lies in wait,
needing only to be recognized; then, she at once enriches
your life and your usefulness. Not a page but contains
thoughts, suggestions, grave and gay, old and new, matter-of-fact
or sublime,&mdash;yet all of them leading to a more sincere
and purposeful understanding of the deeds and thoughts that
make up a sound and full career. But of all these thousands of
pages and selections not any contain more hints for the reader
than the pages of the Index.</p>


<p><b>The Use of the Biographical Sketches.</b> The reader who
has once grasped the inestimable value of reflecting on the
books that he meets, will naturally perceive the worth of the
Biographical Sketches that immediately precede the selections
in the <span class="smcap">Library</span>. For although these are purposely terse, yet
they have been painstakingly constructed to supply two
essential needs; first, an introduction to the author, as well
as to his best work; second, a guide to his other works.</p>

<p>As has elsewhere been pointed out (pages 19, 28, 55, etc.,
of this Handbook), the true appreciation and enjoyment of
a writer are unquestionably increased by understanding his
personality and his outlook on the world.</p>

<p>In the second place, the selections present the best and only
the best achievements of each writer. They obviously cannot
include thirty volumes of Scott's novels, for example;
nor is it desirable that the quotations from any author should
extend beyond complete passages of assured distinction. On
the other hand, persons attracted by an author's style or subject
matter will naturally desire to read more of his work and
even to acquire several of his most characteristic books.
The Biographical Sketch lists his principal writings so that
you can send for them to bookseller or public library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Library of Entertainment</span> will thus form the
nucleus of a collection that can become unique, in that it will
not contain an author that you have not tested before purchase.
To own books that you value and esteem unfailingly
leads to reading with increased pleasure day by day; such
reading forms the purpose that lies behind these volumes.</p>

<h3><a name="LITERARY_CRITICISM" id="LITERARY_CRITICISM"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LITERARY CRITICISM</a></h3>


<p>Criticism is a term that is commonly misused and misunderstood.
It does not mean condemnation and disapproval.
It does mean sound judgment, a careful valuation of the work
under discussion, weighing its merits and its faults; therefore
it follows that sincere criticism may be wholly free from fault-finding,
provided the subject proves to be without blemish.
The criticism of Milton's minor poems, "L'Allegro," "Il
Penseroso," and "Lycidas," must be an appreciation of
their beauty and power, since they are practically faultless.</p>

<p>To form a trustworthy opinion regarding a piece of literature
is not difficult; all that is necessary is to make a definite,
orderly inquiry into certain essential facts.</p>

<p>I. The first of these concern the author himself, his surroundings,
and the influences which shaped his thoughts.</p>

<p>1. <b>The period when he lived.</b> Each of the great ages of
literature has its special characteristics and tendencies, without
a knowledge of which it is impossible to judge a writer's
work. (These periods are defined on p. 19 ff.) For example, if
Dickens had lived in Shakespeare's time his writings would
have been very different in form and in style; he would have
probably written comedies for the stage instead of novels.</p>

<p>2. <b>His nation.</b> Nationality also has strong traits that
must be taken into account. (These are stated on p. 28 ff.)
If Dickens had been a Frenchman, he would have paid more
attention to the grace and clearness of his style; if he had been
a German, he would have tended to be more philosophical in
his thought, his plots would have been deeper, and his characters
less vivid.</p>

<p>3. <b>His life and immediate surroundings.</b> Equally significant
are the social conditions in which a man is reared, whether
noble, like Byron, or poor, like Burns; well-educated, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Macaulay, or self-taught, like Bunyan; unfortunate and
dissipated, like Poe, or fortunate and happy, like Holmes.
These facts all have a direct bearing on the view we must take
of the man's productions. Joel Chandler Harris could never
have written his amusing "Uncle Remus" stories, if he had not
spent his boyhood on a Southern plantation. De Quincey
would never have written "Our Ladies of Sorrow" if he had
not been the slave of opium. Stevenson's "Travels With a
Donkey," one of his most charming books, is due to the fact
that his consumptive tendencies compelled him to go on a
walking trip in the pure and bracing air of the mountains of
southern France.</p>

<p>II. A second group of facts deals with the work itself.</p>

<p>1. <b>The form</b>; poetry, fiction, history, essay, drama, etc.
(These are discussed on p. 36 ff.)</p>

<p>2. <b>The style.</b> The worth of the author's work as a piece of
composition is best decided by observing the following elements,
which taken all together make up the style and quality
of his writing.</p>

<p>What <b>words</b> does he use? Are they commonplace or do
they express his exact meaning? Are they simple, or unusual
and even unintelligible? Are they forceful or weak? etc.</p>

<p>How are his <b>sentences</b> constructed? Are they straightforward
or confused? Do they express a simple, direct
thought or do they contain several ideas? If complex and
lengthy, are they still powerful? etc.</p>

<p>Are his <b>paragraphs</b> unified; that is, do they contain one
leading idea? Do they follow in systematic order, leading
from one to the other? Is the development of the author's
subject easily followed? etc.</p>

<p>Are the <b>scenes</b> and <b>characters</b>, the <b>plots</b> and <b>purposes</b>
clearly shown? Does it require more than one reading to find
out what the writer is trying to say? Is his work convincing?
Do the characters change, and if so, is the change natural or
does it seem unreal and artificial? Are the incidents natural
or do some of the events seem forced? If the latter, do
you think the author is justified? What is the author's
aim? Has he any further purpose than that which is
immediately evident? etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the <b>tone</b> of his work? Realism? Imagination?
Mystery? Charm? Beauty? Accuracy? Delicacy? Pathos?
Humor? Joy? Sarcasm? etc.</p>

<p>3. <b>The effect.</b> What are <b>your feelings</b> regarding the
work? Do you like it or dislike it? Why?</p>

<p>What is your cold <b>judgment</b> regarding it? Note that this
is by no means necessarily the same thing as what you may
feel. Many people do not care especially for Dickens or
Kipling, yet they all grant that both these authors have deserved
their fame. They may not like them, but their reason
and their judgment compel admission of their ability. It is
accordingly important to ask what impression a book makes
on your feelings and on your judgment as well, and to ask
why that impression has grown upon you.</p>

<p>The value of this systematic consideration of a passage of
literature is manifest. The reader's knowledge is increased,
and, better still, his ability to arrive at a wise judgment of
other literature is greater than before. Efficiency in habits of
thought is encouraged, his outlook on life is broader, he becomes
more fit to take a prominent part in social and in business
life, wherever judgment and thought are needed.</p>

<p>In making use of these Studies, the reader is advised to
adopt the following method:</p>

<p>Read the sketches of the author in the Study and in front
of the selections and then read the selections themselves.
Next answer the questions in the Study, taking care to give
reasons for each answer, with illustrations carefully chosen
from the author's work, wherever possible. In making comparisons
between authors or selections remember that points
of contrast as well as of likeness should be considered.</p>

<p>Be sure to keep in mind the essentials of <span class="smcap">Part II</span>, and
refer not only to them but to the <span class="smcap">Index</span> for references to
national characteristics, history, and authors.</p>

<p>Further reading should be selected from the author's works
given in the notes which precede the selections and from the
biographical and critical works mentioned at the end of each
Study.</p>

<h4>ROBERT BURNS</h4>

<p class="center">(1759&ndash;1796)</p>

<p>Robert Burns was born and spent most of his life in Ayrshire,
in the lowlands of Scotland. Broad-minded, tolerant,
and trusting, he had a place in his heart for all men, whatever
their failings. His thoughtless love of good-fellowship was
the principal cause of his untimely end.</p>

<p>His best songs, dealing with the common life of the Lowlands
and written in the Scottish dialect, were as a rule spontaneous;
though "The Cotter's Saturday Night," probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
reminiscent of his boyhood home, is a more finished and
careful production.</p>

<p>He is the greatest of Scotch poets. Since Shakespeare
there has been no better interpreter of the human heart.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. Why is Burns called the Ayrshire Bard? Locate
Ayrshire on the map.</p>

<p>2. From what rank of society did Burns come?</p>

<p>3. What was his attitude toward the humbler classes of
society? II, 379. Toward men in general?</p>

<p>4. What can you say as to his patriotism?</p>

<p>5. Was he a favorite with the public?</p>

<p>6. See Carlyle's opinion of his reception by the public,
III, 55; of his worth, III, 102.</p>

<p>7. To what may we ascribe his rapid decline and early
death?</p>

<p>8. What do you judge his views would be as to the merits
of Romanticism and Classicism?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. What portion of Great Britain is the scene of most of
Burns' poems?</p>

<p>2. Were they the product of deliberate art or spontaneous
impulse?</p>

<p>3. Have his poems any great influence at the present
time?</p>

<p>4. Is his best work in English or in the Scotch dialect?
Explain why?</p>

<p>5. Do you consider it worth while to master the difficulties
of the dialect?</p>

<p>6. What is your opinion as to the love element in his
poetry?</p>

<p>7. There have been but few better interpreters of nature.</p>

<p>8. Like many a Scotchman of his day he seems to have had
a full appreciation of the joys of conviviality.</p>

<p>9. Had Burns the element of humor in any marked degree?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>10. Compare his songs with those of Shakespeare, Jonson,
Byron, Shelley, and Tennyson; for feeling, polish, and
power.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">"THE COTTER'S SATURDAY NIGHT"</p>

<p>1. Is the scene laid in the Highlands or the Lowlands?</p>

<p>2. Does the fact that the poem is written in the Scotch
dialect add to or detract from its beauty? The mingling of
literary language and dialect is intentional; discuss the
value of this.</p>

<p>3. Would you judge Burns to have been at heart a religious
man?</p>

<p>4. What comparison does the author draw between Scotch

<h4>SIR WALTER SCOTT</h4>

<p class="center">(1771&ndash;1832)</p>

<p>Scott first achieved success as a poet; but as his fame
began to pale before the rising star of Byron, he wisely dropped
verse and appeared as a writer of fiction, in which he was
far more successful. Some critics consider "Ivanhoe" the
greatest romance ever written. Many of his early novels are
of almost equal merit. With "Woodstock" and "Anne of
Geierstein," a decline in his powers is perceptible.</p>

<p>Scott may be considered the founder of the historical novel,
and it is doubtful if he has ever been excelled. His scenes
of medieval life are somewhat overdrawn, it is true, though
possibly no more so than the requirements of successful
fiction demanded.</p>

<p>Several of his ancestors had taken a prominent part in the
warfare of the Border, a fact which largely accounts for his
great interest in Scottish legend.</p>

<p>He earned more by his writings than any other literary
man of the period. At his country seat, Abbotsford, he
entertained with lavish hospitality. It became a resort of
scholars; and Washington Irving and many other Americans
visited him there. He lived and died practically without an
enemy, even Byron, who assailed him so bitterly at one time,
being won over by his magnanimity. He refused the post of
poet laureate in favor of his friend Southey.</p>

<p>His publishing house failing in 1828 with a shortage of
over half a million, Scott chivalrously devoted the last
six years of his life to the payment of the debt, a feat
which he had almost accomplished when death overtook
him.</p>

<p>Although among the first and best of the prose writers of
the Romantic period and a decided follower of the Romantic
principles in his work, yet Scott was so conservative in politics
and so patriotic a supporter of monarchy that the revolutionary
spirit of the French Revolution and the passion for liberty
that inspired many authors of the day had slight influence on
him.</p>

<h4>WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</h4>

<p class="center">(1770&ndash;1850)</p>

<p>Wordsworth, the first of the English poets of Romanticism,
came of age just as the storm of the French Revolution
broke over Europe. In 1791, after he had taken his degree
at Cambridge University, he went to France, where he spent
nearly a year, fascinated by the struggle for freedom, and only
returned when his friends stopped his allowance and so compelled
him to withdraw from danger.</p>

<p>He deliberately chose poetry as his profession, working
with Coleridge for the purpose of establishing new laws of
poetic composition. In 1798 they published a little volume,
the "Lyrical Ballads," which marked a radical departure
from the artificial and affected style of the latter days of the
Classic Age. (See also notes on Coleridge, <a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a> of this
volume.)</p>

<p>He eventually settled in the Lake District, in the north-west
of England, where Coleridge and Southey, the other two
'Lake Poets,' spent many years. His income was a mere
trifle, but he and his sister Dorothy lived in tranquil simplicity
on the borders of Grasmere until his circumstances improved.
In 1802 he was able to marry and soon after he moved to
Rydal Mount, a larger abode near by, and also overlooking
a stretch of water enclosed by the heathery mountains.
Here he spent the last thirty-eight years of his life, dying at
the age of eighty. Almost all the greater writers of his day
were among his friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>As a lover of nature, delighting in travel amid lovely scenery,
he found his answer to the problem of life in the tranquillity
and ever present spirit of law and duty which he perceived
in all nature's forms. For him the presence of God was
manifest in fields and mountains, in flowers and brooks, as
much as in the lives of men and women.</p>

<p>Poetry, in his conception, was the preservation of impressions
in such form that when read it would again create those
impressions. Its language should be extremely simple, hardly
departing from that of everyday life and conversation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
petty incidents of daily experience for him often contained
such deep suggestions of beauty and good that he recorded
them at length.</p>

<p>It was this utter simplicity of attitude and tone that made
him the object of slashing criticism for some time. An absolute
innovator, his work was as absurd in the eyes of the critics
as the wildest freaks of the cubists are to us. At last he
became a subject of discussion instead of ridicule, then of
praise, and finally of lasting fame. Yet much of his work is
far better unread to-day; only in his earlier verse, when the
inspiration of youth and the freshness of his message still
urged him, is there any true greatness evident. His later
work, like his later years, is cold and conservative. He made
no further progress, once he had given expression to his first
radical ideas. This tendency was rebuked by Browning in
"The Lost Leader."</p>

<h4>SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE</h4>

<p class="center">(1772&ndash;1834)</p>

<p>A victim of the opium habit after the age of thirty and by
nature irresolute and dreamy, Coleridge led a wandering life,
leaving his family with his friend Southey.</p>

<p>Most of his poetry, small in volume, though unexcelled in
quality, was written before he was thirty, "The Ancient
Mariner," his first poem, having been composed at the age
of twenty-four. After this he devoted himself for the most
part to metaphysical speculation of no permanent value.</p>

<p>He excelled all other writers of his day in dealing with the
supernatural. "The Ancient Mariner," his masterpiece, is a
successful attempt to revive the metrical ballad of the middle
ages. By the use of rubrics the medieval effect is heightened,
while the introduction of the wedding guest relieves the
credibility of the reader by making of an improbable account
simply 'a tale that is told.'</p>

<p>He lived for some time at Keswick in Cumberland near its
group of celebrated lakes, where Wordsworth and Southey
also resided, and hence the appellation of "Lake Poets,"
given to the three distinguished friends.</p>

<p>Joining with Wordsworth in 1798 in the publication of a
little volume of verse, "Lyrical Ballads," he became one of
the first to give voice to the movement known as Romanticism.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. What influence had Coleridge on the literature of his
day?</p>

<p>2. What is said of him as a conversationalist? As a critic?
III, 92 ff.</p>

<p>7. Read the poems by Wordsworth, XII, 332-339; these
were published in the volume, "Lyrical Ballads," with "The
Ancient Mariner"; how are they characteristic of Romanticism?</p>

<p>8. "Kubla Khan," like Poe's "Raven," has frequently
been attributed to an opium vision. This cannot be proved,
but it is well known that he dreamed these lines and many
more which he forgot before he could write them down. In
character it is closely akin to De Quincey's account of opium
dreams, IV, 171 ff.</p>

<h4>GEORGE GORDON, LORD BYRON</h4>

<p class="center">(1788&ndash;1824)</p>

<p>George Gordon, sixth Lord Byron, was born in London.
His father, a profligate captain of the guards, having squandered
most of his wife's property, she parted from him, retiring on
a small income to Aberdeen, Scotland. In his eleventh year,
however, the son inherited the title and estate of his grand-uncle,
and the mother and son left Scotland and settled down
at Newstead Abbey, near Nottingham, in Sherwood Forest.</p>

<p>Byron prepared for the university at Harrow and then
went to Cambridge, where he published "Hours of Idleness,"
a volume of verse of no merit that brought down the unduly
savage review of Brougham, to which Byron replied anony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>mously
with "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers," a dashing
satire that he later suppressed, when he became a friend
of many whom he there held up to ridicule.</p>

<p>Soon after receiving his M.A. he made a two years' tour of
Portugal, Spain, Albania, and Greece, composing meanwhile
the first two cantos of "Childe Harold," published in 1812.
So immediate was its success that he literally "woke up one
morning and found himself famous." Though not so fine as
the last two cantos, yet they are full of the new spirit of
Romanticism. The poetic tales of "The Giaour," "The
Bride of Abydos," "The Corsair," and "Lara" followed in
quick succession. All this time he had felt financial pressure
and several of his friends had died, including his mother,
whom he loved notwithstanding her uncertain temper, so that
his life had by no means been happy, and the cynical tone
of much of his verse was a direct expression of his feelings.
His health was also marred by a tendency to corpulence which
he tried to check by a rigid and scanty diet, while a deformed
foot gave him both pain and constant embarrassment.</p>

<p>It is true that he was given to the dissipation then so rife
in England, yet although a libertine from the modern point
of view, there is not sufficient reason for the bitterly relentless
tone adopted by many biographers and critics. He determined
to remedy matters by marrying, but the experiment
proved unfortunate, the couple separated and at the outburst
of public indignation that followed, though unjustified,
Byron went into voluntary exile, never to return.</p>

<p>Most of his subsequent life was spent at various places in
Italy, where he completed "Childe Harold," and wrote "Don
Juan" and a number of shorter poems, and tried his hand at
drama. For a time he worked together with Leigh Hunt and
Shelley at Pisa.</p>

<p>His life in Italy was licentious, a tendency that colored his
later works, notably "Don Juan"; although his intellectual
powers would seem to have grown up to the time of his premature
death.</p>

<p>The close of his life went far toward redeeming his wayward
career. He flew to the assistance of the Greeks struggling
for independence from the barbaric Turkish rule, and devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his means and his life to their service. Finding them at sixes
and sevens among themselves, he showed the qualities of a
statesman and soldier and soon brought order out of chaos.
But a few months' exposure led to a fever from which he died.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. To what is the so-called "satanic" element in his life
to be ascribed?</p>

<p>2. Where were Byron's early years spent?</p>

<p>3. In what manner did he acquire Oriental coloring for his
poetic romances?</p>

<p>4. What led to his withdrawal from England?</p>

<p>5. Among his intimate friends were Moore and Shelley;
Leigh Hunt, Scott, and Coleridge were also appreciative
acquaintances. Compare their work with his.</p>

<p>6. Give the circumstances of his death.</p>

<p>7. Goethe refers to Byron's love of exercise. IV, 398.</p>

<p>8. He seems to have been something of a dandy and a
snob, but with redeeming features. VII, 38; XII, 89.</p>

<p>9. Why is his life, as well as his work, typical of the extreme
tendency of the Romantic Period?</p>

<p>10. Read Hunt's account of Byron. VII, 217 ff.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. Give Matthew Arnold's estimate of Byron. I, 190.</p>

<p>2. Was he as fully equipped as Tennyson for the position
of the supreme modern poet? I, 191.</p>

<p>3. Does Chesterton's estimate of Byron coincide with that
of Arnold? III, 267.</p>

<p>4. As to Goethe's views of Byron's pictorial powers, see
IV, 388.</p>

<p>5. In his choice of themes, did he favor cheerful subjects?
IV, 388.</p>

<p>6. Was Byron's early death a real loss to literature? IV,
399.</p>

<p>7. Why were Byron's tragedies his least successful performances?

<p>8. Is his fame destined to endure? I, 181.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Why did Byron fail, while Spenser succeeded, in applying
the spirit of his age to English literature? I, 180.</p>

<p>10. What characteristics of Romanticism appear in his
work? Contrast it with that of Pope and Goldsmith. Compare
it with Burns.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "CHILDE HAROLD"</p>

<p>1. The selections from "Childe Harold" represent Byron
at his best in spirit and in style.</p>

<p>2. "Greece"; why does Byron use the phrase, "sad relic
of departed worth"?</p>

<p>3. "Waterloo"; show how the poet by skilful changes in
wording, as well as in choice of expressions, works steadily to
the climax of the last line. Note the breaks and varied measure
of the metrical rhythm.</p>

<p>4. Contrast the feeling in "Venice" and in "Rome";
in which is it more melancholy; more profound; more sentimental;
more forceful? Why?</p>

<p>5. Which impresses you more, "The Dying Gladiator"
or "Laocoon and Apollo"? Which of these pieces of statuary
do you think Byron was most affected by? Why?</p>

<p>6. "Solitude" and "The Ocean" are famous examples of the
Byronic attitude toward nature. Is this the same as Wordsworth's

<h4>PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY</h4>

<p class="center">(1792&ndash;1822)</p>

<p>Shelley was from his earliest youth equally distinguished
by poetic gifts of the highest order and by a reckless and
ungovernable disposition. After thorough preliminary education,
he was sent to Oxford, where he displayed rare literary
talent, but from which he was expelled for publishing a tract
on "The Necessity of Atheism."</p>

<p>After eloping with the sixteen-year-old daughter of a retired
tavern-keeper, Harriet Westbrook, whom he married in
Scotland, he led a wandering life for a time until his financial
position was improved upon his coming of age in 1813. By
this time he and his wife had become estranged, and Shelley
eloped with Mary Godwin and settled on the Continent.
Two years later his wife committed suicide by drowning, and
when Shelley attempted to secure the custody of his two
children, it was denied him. Shelley now left England for
good, visited one Italian city after another, and finally settled
down at Pisa. Keats, Byron, and Hunt were among his
close friends. "Adonais" is an elegy to Keats's memory.</p>

<p>His poems may be divided into two classes. In the first
class we have his three long poems, "Queen Mab," "The
Revolt of Islam," and "Prometheus Unbound," each an
attempt to apply the revolutionary principles of the period.
In these he displays a progressive improvement, appearing
at his best in "Prometheus Unbound."</p>

<p>The second class, embracing "Alastor," "Adonais," and
many shorter poems, includes his subjective works. They
exceed in melody and illusive and mysterious beauty anything
else of the century. The spirit of freedom and the spirit of
beauty were the subjects of his muse.</p>

<p>With some faults he had much beauty of character. He
was beloved by all who knew him. He was kindness itself
and spent much of his time dispensing charity among the
poor, even to the point of self-deprivation. Easily excited to
indignation at the least suspicion of oppression or wrong, he
was at other times the gentlest of men.</p>

<h4>JOHN KEATS</h4>

<p class="center">(1795&ndash;1821)</p>

<p>The son of an hostler in a livery-stable, with only a partial
education, John Keats certainly would not be chosen as a
possible equal of Shelley, Byron, Wordsworth, or Coleridge.
Yet such was his genius that he attained this position with
no other training than came from his love of reading, especially
in the fields of mythology and poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few years at school he was apprenticed to a surgeon,
and studied at the hospitals for a time, but disliking the profession
he gave himself up to reading and then to authorship.
Shakespeare, Wordsworth, the Italian poets, and later, Milton,
were among his favorites. He was well built and strong,
yet exposure brought on consumption in 1818, shortly after
the publication of "Endymion." Whether the decline in his
health was due to the violent attacks upon his poem by the
reviewers or to the fact that he nursed a consumptive brother
for the three months preceding the latter's death is still considered
an open question by many. Shelley and Byron were
bitter against the reviews and attributed his steady decline to
that source alone. Meanwhile he worked on his last and
greatest poems, while his health went to pieces. When it was
too late for hope he sailed to Italy with his friend Severn, in
whose arms he died a few months later. Not quite two
years afterward Shelley's remains were laid beside him in the
Protestant Cemetery at Rome, and in 1881 Severn, too, found
his last resting-place there.</p>

<p>The epitaph which Keats had inscribed on his tomb,</p>

<p class="pfs80">"Here lies one whose name was writ in water,"</p>

<p class="noindent">is happily proved false. Even to-day it is probable that he
has not reached the highest recognition which he is to win in
the world of poetry.</p>

<p>The one idea at the foundation of all his writings is the
much-quoted phrase which begins "Endymion,"&mdash;"A thing
of beauty is a joy forever," or as he expressed it in the "Ode
on a Grecian Urn,"&mdash;"Beauty is truth." He is the poet of
the senses, luxuriant, yet sublime. The Odes, "The Eve of
St. Agnes," and "Hyperion" are hardly to be matched in the
whole realm of English poetry. Strange to say Keats never
studied Greek, leaving school before he reached that subject.
Yet his work is nearer that of the Greeks in its exquisite
balance of reason and feeling, in its absolute appreciation of
beauty, and in purity of tone and style, nearer than that of
all other English writers. But this is only true of his best
work; in his other verse he lacks in taste and proportion, lavishing
description without measure on every object of any charm.</p>

<h4>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</h4>

<p class="center">(1809&ndash;1892)</p>

<p>Alfred Tennyson, generally accounted the greatest English
poet since Milton, was born at Somersby, Lincolnshire,
where his early studies were for the most part personally
directed by his father, the rector of the parish. He then
studied at Cambridge, where "The Lady of Shalott" and "A
Dream of Fair Women," were written.</p>

<p>Criticism and the death of a dearly loved friend, Arthur
Hallam, now drove the tender-souled Tennyson into a retirement
from which he did not reappear for nine years. He
was busy during all this time, composing and perfecting
"Locksley Hall," "Dora," "Morte D'Arthur," and other
poems whose publication placed him in the front rank as a
poet. "The Princess" followed in 1847 and "In Memoriam,"
his noblest work, an elegy on the death of Arthur Hallam, in
1850, seventeen years after his friend's decease.</p>

<p>In the same year he was appointed poet laureate and married
a Miss Sellwood. Nine years later appeared his great epic
cycle, "Idylls of the King." In 1884 he was raised to the
peerage. "Crossing the Bar," published shortly before his
death, was a fitting close to a literary life nobly consecrated
to the combat against skepticism and materialism.</p>

<h4>ROBERT BROWNING</h4>

<p class="center">(1812&ndash;1889)</p>

<p>Of German descent, Browning was, like so many other
famous English writers, a native of London. His father was
a ready versifier and his mother an accomplished musician,
and they encouraged in every possible manner the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of like talent in their son. In his youth he drank deep of
those fountains of romanticism, Byron, Shelley, and Keats.</p>

<p>His schooling finished and the tour of the Continent made,
he devoted his life to literature, producing a number of dramatic
poems of more or less merit. It was not, however,
until the period 1841 to 1846 that, by the publication of the
series of poems entitled "Bells and Pomegranates," which
included "Pippa Passes," he attained any great literary fame.
The latter play attracted the attention of Miss Barrett, and
led to an acquaintance which resulted in their marriage in
1846.</p>

<p>The Brownings left at once for Florence, Italy, where they
led an ideal married life until the death of Mrs. Browning in
1861. Like his wife, he took a great interest in Italy, and after
her death his time was divided between England, where his
son was being educated, and Italy. In the years immediately
following Mrs. Browning's death, he composed "The Ring
and the Book," a long epic poem commonly accounted his
masterpiece; he continued writing until his death in 1889,
his last work being published as he lay on his deathbed.</p>

<p>Browning was a short, stocky, active man, mingling freely
with all classes of society and totally unlike the generality of
poets. His works largely reflect the man, one noticeable
feature being the entire absence of poetic melancholy.</p>

<p>Browning and Tennyson loomed above all the other poets
of their day, and their comparative merits were a fertile
source of argument even then. Both men were, however, too
large to be affected by such considerations, and their relations
were always of the most cordial nature.</p>

<p>Browning is deeply analytic, a trait perhaps derived from
his German ancestors along with his peculiarities of syntax
and vocabulary and his obscurity of expression. The latter
characteristic has largely discouraged the general public, so
that the reading of Browning is limited to people with a
literary turn. His poetry is, however, well worth the reading.
He is by far the deepest poet of the nineteenth century. He
leaves environment to lesser poets and concentrates all his
energies upon man himself, his passions and emotions. His
nature is essentially dramatic, and had he devoted himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
strictly to drama, instead of lyric verse, he doubtless would
have been far more appreciated by the public. His poetic
monologues, such as "Andrea del Sarto," "Confessions," and
"Prospice," dramatic in nature, are rather hampered and confusing
because of their form.</p>

<h4>ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING</h4>

<p class="center">(1809&ndash;1861)</p>

<p>Elizabeth Barrett Browning, easily first among English
poets of her sex, was born in Durham. The daughter of a
rich retired India merchant, she was remarkably precocious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
reading Homer in the original, and writing verse at the age of
eight years.</p>

<p>In 1836 the family removed to London, where she commenced
her life-work. Despite the fact that she was a chronic
invalid, she was familiar with the language and literature of
several nations. Her poems of this period reflect her deep
interest in social and humanitarian questions.</p>

<p>At this very time, when her fame far exceeded his, Robert
Browning called on her to thank her for a compliment paid
him in one of her poems. It seems to have been a case of
love at first sight. They were married in 1846 and soon removed
to Florence, Italy.</p>

<p>The "Sonnets from the Portuguese," among the world's
noblest love poems, contain the record of her courtship and
marriage.</p>

<p>In Italy she regained her health somewhat, and it was here
that most of her best works were written. She took a great
interest in the cause of Italian independence, as appears from
"Casa Guidi Windows," and many lesser poems.</p>

<p>Although she began to write at an early age, she reached
maturity slowly, producing her best works only after her
fortieth year. She died in 1861.</p>

<p>Her characteristic note is that of sympathy, but her insight
into human character was not particularly deep. The greatest
faults in her style are vagueness and lack of self-restraint,
probably to be attributed to her extremely sensitive temperament
and overflowing imagination.</p>

<h4>WASHINGTON IRVING</h4>

<p class="center">(1783&ndash;1859)</p>

<p>Washington Irving has the distinction of being the only
one of our early writers of eminence born in the metropolis;
and, with the exception of Cooper, the only one born outside
of New England.</p>

<p>The youngest son of a well-to-do New York merchant, he
was born in 1783, just after the close of the Revolutionary
War. He was, therefore, very properly christened "Washington."
It is said that some years after, he was brought to
President Washington, who, on being told that he was a namesake,
laid his hand upon him and bestowed his blessing.
Little could the Father of His Country have realized that the
benediction would bear fruit and that the recipient thereof
was to become the Prince of American Letters.</p>

<p>Like many other authors he studied for the bar, but found
neither law nor politics congenial. Though well-read, his education
was unsystematic. His first literary endeavors appeared
in "Salmagundi," a semimonthly periodical in which
he collaborated with his brother and James Kirk Paulding.
This was followed by his inimitable "Knickerbocker's History
of New York," still among the greatest masterpieces of American
humor, which established his reputation.</p>

<p>In 1814 he sailed for Europe, where the next seventeen years
of his life were spent. Several years were divided between
Great Britain and France, where the "Sketch-Book," "Bracebridge
Hall," and "Tales of a Traveler" were written. Afterwards
he spent some years in Spain writing his striking series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of works descriptive of Spanish history and antiquities&mdash;"The
Conquest of Granada," "The Alhambra," etc.</p>

<p>Returning to America, he built a beautiful home at "Sunnyside"
(rightly named for one who always looked on the sunny
side of life), where he resided continuously during the remaining
twenty-seven years of his life, with the exception of four
years spent as minister of the United States at the Court of
Spain. These latter years were full of labor, the most notable
results being his lives of Goldsmith and Washington.</p>

<p>His writings are distinguished by an easy grace, a flowing
rhythm, a light play of fancy and humor, a delicate and tender
sentiment sometimes suffused with a gentle melancholy,
smooth and unaffected narrative, picturesque description, and
graphic delineation of character.</p>

<p>Thackeray describes him as being in his family "gentle,
generous, good-humored, and self-denying;" and in society
"a delightful example of complete gentlemanliness."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. What peculiarity of birth distinguishes Irving from all
other ante bellum writers?</p>

<p>2. What was his education; his social position?</p>

<p>3. Note points of resemblance between his life and that of
Bryant.</p>

<p>4. In what countries was a considerable portion of his life
spent?</p>

<p>5. Where did he spend his days after his return from
Europe?</p>

<p>6. What public service did Irving render his country?</p>

<p>7. Summarize his character.</p>

<p>8. In view of the many years he voluntarily spent abroad,
would you consider him a patriotic man?</p>

<h4>EDGAR ALLAN POE</h4>

<p class="center">(1809&ndash;1849)</p>

<p>Although born in Boston, Poe was of Southern descent
and received his early education in England and Virginia. He
belonged to no school of writers. His works are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>
and bear no local color or imprint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Though a loving husband, he was throughout his life practically
without friends, his caustic criticism in particular making
him many enemies in the world of letters, with disastrous
effect on the reception of his writings. His life was consequently
one long struggle for bare necessities, in spite of
which, working with unflagging energy, he left behind several
volumes of poems, tales, and criticism of a high order.</p>

<p>The wonderful technique, faultless form, and painstaking
choice of detail, combined with the grotesque and morbid
beauty of both his poetry and his prose have secured for Poe
an abiding place in our literature. It is the perfection of
literary style that has given him his great popularity abroad
and especially in France. Indeed, Poe's neglect of the moral
point of view and his constant achievement of artistic perfection
of form are French rather than English or American
characteristics.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. Poe was born in Boston. Would you class him with the
New England school of writers?</p>

<p>2. Where did he receive his early education? Does this
account for certain peculiarities in his writings?</p>

<p>3. Was Poe a man of warm sympathies?</p>

<p>4. What were his relations with other writers of his day?</p>

<p>5. Was the circle of his friendship extensive? What effect
had this on his ultimate success as a writer?</p>

<p>6. Compare Scott and Poe as money-makers.</p>

<p>7. What is your opinion of Poe as a husband?</p>

<p>8. He was not a hard drinker as compared with men of his
time. The malevolence of his literary executor is responsible
in part for the belief to the contrary. On the other hand his
will was not strong enough to resist the insidious craving for
alcohol and opium, and his high-strung temperament was
affected by a slight quantity of either poison.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. What rank do you assign to Poe among American poets?
Among short-story writers?</p>

<p>2. Wherein lay his strength?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>3. What elements of weakness do you observe?</p>

<p>4. In "The Fall of the House of Usher" notice how the
atmosphere of horror is fixed in the opening paragraph by a
series of adjectives and adverbs expressive of ever increasing
gloom and culminating in the word "torture."</p>

<p>5. Compare the nightmare dread that is attained both at
the end of "The Fall of the House of Usher" and in "The
Cask of Amontillado" with De Quincey's description of the
dreams caused by opium and the attendant melancholia. IV,
171-181.</p>

<p>6. However, Poe was not merely recording fragments of
opium dreams; the earliest prose work of the romantic period,
now forgotten because of its many weaknesses and imperfections,
consisted largely of just such tales of horror. Bürger's
"Lenore," Walpole's "Castle of Otranto," Mrs. Radcliffe's
"Mysteries of Udolpho," and Mrs. Shelley's "Frankenstein"
were among the foremost of these.</p>

<p>7. Can you discover any suggestions of religious or moral
feeling in either of these tales? If so, do they impress you as
Poe's actual conviction or as a part of the picture which he is
drawing?</p>

<p>8. Is this type of tale worth preserving apart from its excellence
in style? Do you think it easy or difficult to tell such
a story? Why?</p>

<p>9. Is Poe immoral or unmoral?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">"THE RAVEN"</p>

<p>1. Why is the raven chosen as the bird of ill omen?</p>

<p>2. Compare the raven with the albatross in Coleridge's
"Ancient Mariner."</p>

<p>3. It has been often claimed that the poem was written by
Poe in a fit of delirium. As a matter of fact it was composed
during his wife's illness and then polished into its present
shape during subsequent months of grief. "The Bells" was
written at the same time.</p>

<p>4. "Annabel Lee" is another expression of his passionate
love for his wife.</p>

<p>5. "The Raven" is written in the first person. Is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
characteristic of Poe? Does he gain anything by it? What
does he lose?</p>

<p>6. Whence was the name, Lenore, derived?</p>

<p>7. What do you understand by the reference to "the
Night's Plutonian shore"?</p>

<p>8. As "The Raven" may be said to be the masterpiece of
American poetry, so the stanza, "Then methought the air
grew denser," is considered the supreme moment in the poem.
Can you see why?</p>

<p>9. For a critical analysis of the structure of this poem see
Poe's essay, "The Philosophy of Composition," in the complete
editions of his works.</p>

<h4>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</h4>

<p class="center">(1804&ndash;1864)</p>

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne, by general repute the greatest of
American novelists, was of sound New England lineage, and
his forefathers had for generations followed the sea. After
graduating from Bowdoin College, where he had formed a
close friendship with Longfellow and Pierce, he returned to
Salem, resolved to take up literature as a life-work.</p>

<p>Here he wrote for years, but with so little success that he
was glad to accept of George Bancroft, the historian, the offer
of a subordinate position in the Boston Custom House. He
had, however, just previously published his first work, "Twice-Told
Tales," to be followed, upon his retirement from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
custom house with the change of administration, by "Grandfather's
Chair."</p>

<p>Some years after he was appointed surveyor of customs at
Salem, then an important port, and the succession of tales which
had come from his pen for so many years suddenly ceased.
But during the following four years of apparent cessation of
literary endeavor, he was but husbanding his forces for a final
effort, and the year 1850 witnessed the publication of his
masterpiece, "The Scarlet Letter," the epic of sin and remorse,
by common consent the best American romance and
by many held without an equal, either here or abroad.</p>

<p>His old schoolmate, Franklin Pierce, having become President
of the United States, Hawthorne was appointed Consul
to Liverpool, and upon the expiration of his term spent two
years traveling in France, Switzerland, and Italy. The "English
Note Books" and "Our Old Home" tell of his life in England,
and "The Marble Faun," one of his greatest works, is
the product of his wanderings in Italy.</p>

<p>His writings are distinguished by a wonderful power of
analysis, and a singularly graceful diction. He seems in a
way the incarnation of the old Puritan spirit, probes the innermost
recesses of the heart, and appears to take a strange
delight in the darker side of life. But he is in no sense morbid;
his musings are merely the offspring of a solitary but eminently
manly spirit. All through his works one realizes the dominating
and all-pervading supremacy of conscience.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

Hawthorne?</p>

<h4>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</h4>

<p class="center">(1794&ndash;1878)</p>

<p>William Cullen Bryant was born among the Berkshire
hills, in Western Massachusetts, the son of a country physician
of limited means. He did not complete his college course,
and after devoting several years to the practice of law, he removed
to New York, where for nearly fifty years he remained
as editor of one of the principal metropolitan papers. He
took a leading part in all public affairs, and was a most uncompromising
abolitionist.</p>

<p>In appearance patriarchal, a "grand old man," he was lofty,
self-contained, and cold. He died at the age of 83, his mental
powers still in full vigor.</p>

<p>He was the first poet of high rank which America produced;
and above all, the first to paint American scenes with a discerning
eye. His poems are American in subject, imagery,
and spirit. The volume of his poetry is not large, nor is its
range wide, but it is characterized by a dignity and simplicity
which imparts a peculiar charm.</p>

<p>His "Thanatopsis," written at the remarkably early age of
eighteen, was the first poem written on the American continent
destined to win enduring fame.</p>

<p>His works are almost entirely devoted to nature. Man is
generally treated merely in the abstract. In all his verse the
tendency to moralize is strongly apparent; but his writings,
though instinct with morality and religion, never rise above
the teachings of natural theology.</p>

New York group? Why?</p>

<h4>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</h4>

<p class="center">(1807&ndash;1882)</p>

<p>Longfellow was born at Portland, Maine, a lineal
descendant of "Priscilla, the Puritan Maiden." He was
educated at Bowdoin College, in which he was subsequently
offered a professorship. To prepare himself for the position
he traveled extensively in Europe, acquainting himself with
its languages and institutions.</p>

<p>After some years at Bowdoin he was appointed to the chair
of modern languages and literature at Harvard. He now
settled down at Cambridge, which remained his home till the
day of his death, though he made several trips to Europe.</p>

<p>After several ineffectual essays at authorship, he won recognition
with his "Voices of the Night." Some years later
appeared a second collection of poems, "Poems of Slavery,"
which, with Whittier's poems and Mrs. Stowe's works, were
largely instrumental in stirring up New England to the evils
of slave-holding. Finally, in 1847, appeared the greatest of
all his works, "Evangeline." It is also remarkable as introducing
the dactylic hexameter of the ancients, ever since
popular in America.</p>

<p>In his choice of subjects Longfellow oscillated between
America and Europe, and, although he doubtless was not
conscious of the fact, his American poems were easily best;
especially "Hiawatha" (based on a Finnish epic, the "Kalevala"),

of a Wayside Inn,"&mdash;all three of which may vie with "Evangeline"
for excellence. He was less successful with his European
poems, though "The Golden Legend," and his translation of
the "Divine Comedy" are good.</p>

<p>Longfellow made several attempts at writing prose fiction,
notably in "Hyperion" and "Kavanaugh," but none of his
prose works proved to be of any permanent value.</p>

<p>Longfellow was neither original nor deep. He attempts to
discover no new secrets in nature. But, like Scott, he was
a lover of the heroic, of the spirit of self-sacrifice. His poems,
whatever their form, are ever subjective, have ever a moral
to teach. And so, like Scott, he has ever been and ever will
be popular. In England and Canada he is said to be even
more popular than Tennyson.</p>

<p>Of all American authors, Longfellow was the model Christian;
noted for his superabundant sympathy, love, and
charity. It is recorded that when Poe lashed him with his
merciless criticism, he was delivering enthusiastic discourses
on Poe's poetry to his classes.</p>

<h4>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</h4>

<p class="center">(1807&ndash;1892)</p>

<p>Whittier was born at Haverhill, Mass., the son of a poor
Quaker farmer. His boyhood was spent at work on his
father's farm and he had few opportunities for schooling.
But he showed his talent for verse at an early age, and
in this manner attracted the interest and friendship of
William Lloyd Garrison. Determined to obtain an education,
he learned the trade of making slippers, and with this
as a means of support was able to attend two years at
Haverhill Academy.</p>

<p>For some years after this he led a shifting life, sometimes
editing one of a number of periodicals with which he was
successively connected, and at other times working the
ancestral farm. In 1836 the farm was sold and the Whittiers
removed to Amesbury, destined to remain his home
until his death in 1892, fifty-six years after.</p>

<p>Whittier was a Quaker, and, like most of that sect, a
zealous champion of abolition. To that cause he sacrificed
ambition and love; and, like most of the early abolitionists,
he suffered for his faith. While editor of the "Pennsylvania
Freeman," at Philadelphia, his printing plant was
sacked and burned by the mob.</p>

<p>Whittier never married. His sister Elizabeth, who became
his lifelong companion, and whose verse is preserved
with his own, shared likewise in the war he made on slavery.</p>

<p>His poems may be divided into two classes: those descriptive
of rural life and scenery, among which the best are "Snow
Bound," his masterpiece, "The Tent on the Beach," "Maud
Muller," and "Among the Hills"; and his polemics against
slavery, including "Voices of Freedom," "Barbara Frietchie,"
and "The Slaves of Martinique." He also collaborated with
Lucy Larcom in the compilation of "Child Life," "Child
Life in Prose," and "Songs of Three Centuries."</p>

<p>Poetry was no fine art with him, and his verse seldom rises
above the ballad; but his style is characterized by great
simplicity, sincerity, directness, and fervor. The elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of passion and sturdier humor are lacking, but he was the
master-painter of New England scenery, as evidenced in his
"Snow Bound," the best verse of that kind since "The Deserted
Village," and "The Cotter's Saturday Night." Rustic
winter scenes have never been more beautifully described.</p>

<p>2. What can you say of his childhood?</p>

<h4>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</h4>

<p class="center">(1819&ndash;1891)</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, the son of a Unitarian minister,
was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the home of so many
of our eminent authors. Educated at Harvard University,
where he also prepared for the practice of law, he entered
that profession, but finding it little to his taste quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
abandoned it for literature. In 1855 he succeeded Longfellow
in the chair of modern languages at Harvard, a position
which he held for the following twenty-two years. During
this period he was for a time editor of the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>,
and the <cite>North American Review</cite>. In 1877 he was appointed
minister to Spain, and in 1880 was transferred to the Court
of St. James, where he remained five years. He died in 1891
at the age of seventy-two years.</p>

<p>Lowell was a many-sided character, eminent as a poet, an
essayist, a critic, and a public speaker. His friends included
all the New England writers of his day and many English
authors, who for the first time appreciated America's intellectual
standing. His poetry is very uneven; this is due
largely to the fact that he wrote principally for immediate
effect, and, while his poems sparkle with wit and humor, they
very commonly lack polish and form. This criticism would
hardly apply to "The Vision of Sir Launfal," his best poem,
or to the "Commemoration Ode."</p>

<p>Lowell is probably better known as an essayist and critic,
his best works in this line being "Fireside Travels," "My
Study Windows," and "Among my Books." He was the
leading American critic of his time.</p>

<p>In closing, two anomalous works should be mentioned.
His "Biglow Papers" are two series of satirical poems, ordinary
verse rather than actual poetry, but very fine as satire.
The former series, published in 1846, was directed against the
Mexican war, and the latter, published during the Civil
War, against the slavery party. They served to popularize
the 'Yankee dialect,' here used for the first time.</p>

<p>The second is the "Fable for Critics," a criticism in verse
of his leading contemporaries, like the "Biglow Papers,"
full of wit and striking puns and keenly critical, though
lacking in true poetic value.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. What similarity between Lowell's antecedents and those
of Emerson?</p>

<p>2. How does his first choice of a profession resemble that
of Bryant and Irving?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Whom did he succeed at Harvard and what chair did
he fill in that institution?</p>

<p>4. Give his connection with journalism.</p>

<p>5. What diplomatic missions did he fill, and what other
famous American authors had filled the same positions?</p>

<p>6. Did he, like Irving, Prescott, and Hawthorne, make
any great use of his European experience for literary purposes?</p>

<p>7. What impression did he make in England?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. Mention seven different lines along which Lowell directed
his energies.</p>

<p>2. What is the principal defect in his style?</p>

<p>4. Mention his three best poems. His three best collections
of essays.</p>

<p>5. Against what evil were the "Biglow Papers" directed?</p>

<p>6. What new element did they bring into American literature?</p>

<p>7. Name a favorite poem in the Yankee dialect.</p>

<p>8. Why is some of his verse scarcely to be considered
poetry?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL"</p>

<p>1. Compare "druid wood" with the opening lines of Longfellow's
"Evangeline," VIII, 231, and explain the allusion.</p>

<p>2. Point out the best couplet in the extract.</p>

<p>3. What beautiful metaphor is near the close of the poem?</p>

<p>4. What analogy may we draw between the tide and the
year-cycle?</p>

<h4>OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES</h4>

<p class="center">(1809&ndash;1894)</p>

<p>The "genial Autocrat" was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
and was the son of a Congregational minister. After
graduating at Harvard, he began the study of law, but, like so
many other authors, not finding it to his taste, changed to
medicine. After finishing his studies in Paris he returned to
America, and opened office in Boston. Despite his fondness
for literature, he gained a fair practice.</p>

<p>In 1847, however, he was elected Professor of Anatomy in
Harvard University, a position he held for thirty-five years.
His duties were far from arduous, so that like Emerson, he
was able to devote much of his time to lecturing and poetry.</p>

<p>The founding of <cite>The Atlantic Monthly</cite> was an important
event in his life. He was engaged to write for it, and the result
was his greatest work, "The Autocrat of the Breakfast
Table," a series of talks on many subjects, interspersed with
some poems. Of the same nature are "The Professor at the
Breakfast Table," "The Poet at the Breakfast Table," and
"Over the Teacups," written at intervals of many years.
They are distinguished by careless grace and irrepressible
humor. The "Autocrat" is the most original and brilliant,
and the series became successively more serious as the doctor
grew older.</p>

<p>These are the works by which he will be remembered, but,
like Lowell, he was a man of many parts, and chose to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in several fields. He was eminent as a physician, lecturer,
poet, and essayist, as we have seen, and he even tried his
hand at fiction. "The Guardian Angel," his best novel,
"Elsie Venner," and "A Mortal Antipathy," have been
called 'medicated novels,' dealing as they do with questions
of heredity and prenatal influence.</p>

<p>He also appeared in the rôle of biographer, with the lives
of his friends, Motley and Emerson.</p>

<p>Holmes was a lovable man, genial, brilliant, witty, and yet
deeply in earnest for all that. He was a thoroughly religious
man and a firm believer in immortality, holding his life to be
merely the avenue or vestibule to a greater beyond. He was,
however, conservative, and took little part in the abolitionist
movement which so agitated his brethren.</p>

<p>He died at the advanced age of eighty-five, having outlived
all his companions in the field of letters.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. Give a brief account of Holmes's birth and antecedents.</p>

<h4>HOMER</h4>

<p class="center">(1000 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>)</p>

<p>The ancient Greek tradition assigned the authorship of the
"Iliad" and the "Odyssey" to the blind bard, Homer, of
whose origin and personality nothing is known, although
seven cities claimed to be his birthplace. More than a
century of the closest study and research, including the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>vestigation
of ancient Troy, has shown that these two
immortal epic poems are hardly to be called the work of
one man, but that they have been compiled and unified
by one poet from several shorter works, dealing with incidents
leading to the fall of Troy and the wanderings of
Odysseus.</p>

<p>The site of Troy, close to the entrance to the Dardanelles,
has been occupied by nine cities, excavations showing their
remains resting in distinct layers, five of which belong to the
pre-Homeric times, the sixth being the city of the "Iliad,"
sacked in the year 1184 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span> Its fall was due, originally, to
a dispute among the gods as to which was the fairest, Hera,
the wife of Zeus, goddess of earthly dominion, Athene, goddess
of wisdom, or Aphrodite, goddess of love. Paris, the
son of Priam, king of Troy, was chosen judge and awarded
the prize to Aphrodite, tempted by her offer of the most
beautiful woman in the world for his wife and rejecting the
bribes of empire and of wisdom which were offered by the
others.</p>

<p>Helen, the wife of Menelaus, whose beauty was acclaimed as
divine, accordingly was abducted by Paris. Menelaus and
his brother, both powerful kings in Greece, collected an army
with the aid of several other Greek princes and set sail at
once for Troy, which they besieged in vain for nine years and
finally captured by the stratagem of the Trojan horse. This
was a huge wooden figure of a horse, in which certain of the
Greek leaders lay hid while the rest sailed away, apparently
giving up the siege and leaving the horse as an offering to
the gods. The Trojans, rejoicing, dragged the monster
within their walls, broken down to admit it, and at nightfall
the concealed Greeks came out and opened the gates to the
rest of their army, which had landed again under cover of
darkness.</p>

<p>Helen's life was spared, as she seems to have been regarded
as a being of another world, guiltless of wrong intent, driven
by fate into these misfortunes. The tragedies that befell
upon the return of Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus
form the subject of the great dramas of Æschylus, Euripides,
and Sophocles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Iliad" narrates events in the course of the siege, in
which Achilles is the Greek hero, angered by Agamemnon
and refusing to lead the troops to battle, until roused by
the death of his friend Patroclus he rushes to the fray and
slays Hector, the Trojan prince and leader, with whose
funeral rites the poem closes.</p>

<p>The fall of Troy is not treated by Homer; in fact it did not
receive the consideration due its dramatic possibilities until
a thousand years later, when Vergil, the Roman poet, described
it in his "Æneid." This may be explained by the fact that
the Greeks desired to hear the tale of their heroism and their
leader's triumph rather than the sorrows of the enemy, while
the Roman emperor Augustus, at whose request Vergil composed
the "Æneid," wished to glorify Rome by tracing her
origin back to the son of the Trojan prince, Æneas, who fled
to Italy after Troy's downfall.</p>

<p>The "Odyssey" recounts the wanderings of the Greek prince,
Odysseus, detained by various casualties on his way home
round the south of Greece to Ithaca, his island home in the
Adriatic, and also deals with his vengeance on the suitors
whom he found endeavoring to win the hand of his faithful
wife Penelope.</p>

<p>The "Iliad," as a piece of literature, seems to belong to
a somewhat earlier day than the "Odyssey." The latter is
more unified in construction, and shows greater knowledge
of travel and a higher religious and social standard.</p>

<p>The selections of the former are from the two great metrical
translations of Pope and of Chapman. Pope's work (1715)
is in the full flower of the Age of Classicism, and is thoroughly
characteristic of that period. Chapman's (1611), less polished,
belongs to the late Renaissance, whose rugged, adventurous
spirit was far nearer that of the Homeric age and
is preferred by many on this account.</p>

<p>The prose translation, from which the passages of the
"Odyssey" are taken, is better suited to present-day taste,
trained by prose fiction rather than verse. It retains as far
as has ever been done the Greek feeling and ideas, with all its
richness of imagery and none of the affectation which we feel
to-day in lengthy verse.</p>

<h4>VERGIL</h4>

<p class="center">(70 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>&ndash;19 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>)</p>

<p>Unlike most distinguished Roman writers, Vergil was
country born, coming from the district of Andes, near Mantua&mdash;hence
'the Mantuan,' as he was known to the scholastics.</p>

<p>After studying at Cremona and Rome, he returned to his
father's small estate and wrote pastoral poetry; but being
obliged to flee when the lands of Italy were assigned by the
Triumvirs to their adherents, he again visited Rome, where
he speedily became a favorite of Augustus. The liberality
of Augustus and his own thrift enabled him to live in comparative
opulence. Most of his life he spent in retirement
on his estate in Campania. Here his time was given
wholly to his art, except in so far as he was taken up with
scientific and antiquarian studies, which he thought essential
to elevate his thought and strengthen his grasp of profound
subjects.</p>

<p>His character is universally commended. He was gentle,
innocent, modest, and of a singular sweetness of disposition.
He is generally conceded to be the greatest Roman poet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the most patriotic. Like other epic poets he was of a philosophic
nature, and unlike the generality of Roman writers,
he was reserved as to his personal feelings. He never married.</p>

<p>Before coming to Rome he had written his "Eclogues," the
first of Latin pastorals, in imitation of Theocritus. His
next poems, the "Georgics," were written to create fresh
interest in agriculture, which had been the mainstay of republican
Rome but was fast falling into decay. But his
enduring fame rests upon the "Æneid," written at the request
of Augustus, which treats of the founding of Rome by a
colony from ancient Troy under the leadership of Æneas.
In it Vergil sums up the glory of Rome and its culmination
under Augustus. The "Æneid," the "Divine Comedy," and
"Paradise Lost" enjoy the distinction of being the only great
epics written in the full light of civilized society, and the
inspiration of the latter works was largely drawn from Vergil.</p>

<p>He was a master of literary form, seen at its best in the
"Georgics" and the "Æneid," though the latter is an unfinished
work with which Vergil was so little satisfied that in
his will he directed its destruction. This wish was rightly
regarded as the fastidious, nervous whim of the poet and was
therefore unheeded.</p>

<p>The "Messianic Eclogue" prophesies the birth of a child
under whose rule the Golden Age with prosperity and happiness
should be restored to the earth. It is not certain what child
the poet had in mind, though the phrase, "a world by righteous
father tamed," would indicate a flattering reference to Antony
or Augustus, who then shared the control of the world.
In the Middle Ages it was firmly believed by the scholars that
Vergil had been divinely inspired with the knowledge of the
coming of Christ, and his fame as a magician was partly based
on this idea.</p>

Homer's warriors. In the main this fact is not immediately
apparent, for Vergil was a consummate artist and took pains
to prevent his work from 'smelling of the lamp'; that is, from
showing its bookish and studied origin. But his phrases are

<h4>DANTE ALIGHIERI</h4>

<p class="center">(1265&ndash;1321)</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri, who ranks with Homer and Shakespeare
as one of the three greatest poets of all time, was a citizen of
the Republic of Florence. Though we commonly think of
him only as a poet, his youth was distinguished by gallant
feats of arms, and he was later one of the principal officers of
the republic. But it was impossible to hold office long under
the turbulent city states of that age. Two factions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Whites and the Blacks, contended for the supremacy at
Florence, and in 1302 Dante, with many of his followers, was
banished from the city.</p>

<p>The remaining nineteen years of Dante's life were spent
in exile, the victorious party at Florence steadily refusing to
remove the ban. He appears to have spent the years wandering
from one seat of learning to another, and from one court
to another, though but little is actually known relative to the
matter. His last years were certainly spent at Ravenna, at
the court of his friend, Guido da Polenta.</p>

<p>Upon his death the fickle republic attempted to secure the
return of the remains of its first citizen, but the request was
denied, and he still lies at Ravenna.</p>

<p>His great poem, the "Vita Nuova" (new life) would well
have served to immortalize him, but it does not compare with
his "Divine Comedy," an account of his journey through hell,
purgatory, and heaven. It is one of the world's greatest
epics. The machinery of the poem was largely derived from
the medieval legends and passion plays. But whether this
be so or not, we know that Dante was thoroughly competent
to have originated everything which the work contains. He
calls Vergil his master, but while Vergil may have been his
equal in style, he was far inferior to Dante in constructive
genius.</p>

<p>When about nine years of age Dante met and was filled
with poetic love for Beatrice Portinari. She married another,
and after her death a couple of years later, Dante married
Gemma Donati, by whom he had several children. Gemma,
it seems, was something of a shrew, and perhaps she cannot
be blamed for not sympathizing with Dante's continued love
for Beatrice. At any rate, she seems to have been a competent
person, and when Dante was banished she successfully
claimed a part of his property as dower and maintained the
family in comfort.</p>

<p>We cannot of course know at this time whether Beatrice
was a person worthy of the adoration so abundantly bestowed.
However this may be, the undying devotion of Dante, whose
nature neither time nor adversity could change, has sufficed
to immortalize her name.</p>

<h4>JOHN MILTON</h4>

<p class="center">(1608&ndash;1674)</p>

<p>John Milton, the son of a scrivener of some means, was
born in London. He studied in succession at St. Paul's
School, London, and Christ's College, Cambridge, and on
account of his beauty, and the purity of his morals, was known
as the "lady of Christ's Church." Upon graduation from
Cambridge he went to live with his father (who had in the
meantime removed to the village of Horton, Buckinghamshire),
determined to devote his life to literature. At Horton he
wrote his early poems, "L'Allegro," "Il Penseroso," "Lycidas,"
and "Comus." "Lycidas" is an elegy in memory of his intimate
friend Henry King, drowned off the Welsh coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>After six years at Horton, he spent fifteen months making
the Continental tour, and would have stayed longer; but the
civil war breaking out, he returned, considering it dishonorable
to be enjoying himself abroad while his countrymen were
striking a blow for freedom. He laid aside all thought of
belles lettres and devoted his pen to the cause of Puritanism,
writing many pamphlets in defense of regicide, freedom of the
press, divorce, etc. In 1849 he was appointed Latin Secretary
to the Council of State, and became the recognized
literary champion of the Government in the fierce controversies
of that age.</p>

<p>Upon the restoration of the monarchy Milton was for a
time in hiding, but after 1660 was permitted to go unmolested.
In his blind old age he again reverted to poetry, and wrote
the immortal epics, "Paradise Lost," "Paradise Regained,"
and the tragedy, "Samson Agonistes."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. What political opinions did Milton hold? VIII, 390.</p>

<p>2. Give your impression of his morals and personal appearance.</p>

<p>3. Account for the three main divisions of his works&mdash;lyric
poems, prose, and epic poems, with their differing tone&mdash;by
his condition in life at different times.</p>

<p>4. In what remarkable respect does Milton's character resemble
that of the Satan of his epic? VIII, 367, 369.</p>

<p>5. With what religious and political party did he ally himself?</p>

<p>6. What office did he hold under the Commonwealth?</p>

<p>7. In what virtues was he preëminent?</p>

<p>6. Why is Milton so little read at the present time? VI,

<p>7. Were the civilization with which he was surrounded and
the learning which he had acquired helps or hindrances to the
composition of a great epic poem? VIII, 350.</p>

<h4>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h4>

<p class="center">(1564&ndash;1616)</p>

<p>Comparatively little is known of Shakespeare's life. His
education was slight, with but "small Latin and less Greek,"
as his friend Ben Jonson puts it. There is little doubt that
the financial depression of the times brought poverty upon
his family, that he was charged with deer-stealing by a local
landlord, Sir Thomas Lucy, and that he soon after went to
London to seek his fortune, at the age of twenty-one, in 1585.
There he seems to have held horses at the theater entrances,
then to have served as "call-boy" for the players, and by 1592
had begun to patch and revise plays. By 1594 he was an
actor, and made more money than by play-writing, although
he is nowhere mentioned as more than passable on the stage.
Original plays had already appeared from his pen, comedies
and historical drama first, followed by the tragedies, and
ending with "A Winter's Tale," and "The Tempest"; the
order of appearance as usually accepted is given in X, 424.
What with the success of his dramatic work, his acting,
and the patronage of the Earl of Southampton, to whom
he dedicated "Venus and Adonis" and "Lucrece," he was
able to take shares in the Globe theater, invest in land
and houses at Stratford, and at last retire, as he long had
wished, to New Place, his Stratford residence, there to spend
his last years as a prosperous landlord. He died in 1616 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
was buried in the chancel of Trinity Church, on the banks of
the Avon. On the stone floor over his grave is the familiar
inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Good friend, for Jesus sake forbeare</p>
<p class="verse">To digg the dust encloased heare;</p>
<p class="verse">Blest be the man that spares thes stones,</p>
<p class="verse">And curst be he that moves my bones."</p>
</div></div>

<p>What books did Shakespeare read? Few, as compared
with the average author of his or any other age. Apart from
the plays which he remade, he gleaned material and plot from
Plutarch (North's translation), Holinshed, Geoffrey of Monmouth's
history of British kings, now almost forgotten because
of its mythical medley and inaccuracy, Boccaccio, Chaucer,
and Montaigne. But the book of human life spread open
before him is the source of his characters and the descriptive
touches that lend vividness to his scenes. Falstaff, Lear,
Rosalind, Antony, Macbeth, and Hamlet are all taken from
his knowledge and observation of human nature in the living
flesh.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

What are the divergences in style; in method of portraying
character?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "KING LEAR"</p>

<p>1. This act from "King Lear" is the most masterful passage
in all Shakespeare's work. The characters are all of them
tense with emotion, either grief-stricken or insane. Lear
himself, at first vexed, then infuriated (XI, 7), broken with
anguish (11), and apprehending madness (16), collapses and
goes completely insane (19). Kent, his faithful retainer, whom
he had previously sent into exile, watches him with a sorrow
that is almost more than he can bear. The Fool, crack-brained
and simple, is the blending of idiocy and shrewdness
sometimes known as 'an innocent.' Edgar, Gloucester's
good son, cast out by his shortsighted father, feigns madness
for the sake of disguise. Each of these four characters represents
a different psychological condition. Such a task as the
dramatic manipulation of these personalities has never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
attempted before or since. Madness, though a common subject
with Shakespeare's contemporaries, has not elsewhere
been handled with success.</p>

<p>The use of prose indicates disorder of the mind; thus Lear
speaks in blank verse until his intellect gives way (19), and
thereafter only when showing the power of reasoning, as in
the speech (35) on which Edgar makes the comment: "O,
matter and impertinency mix'd!" The Fool uses prose or
nonsense rhyme throughout; Edgar while playing the madman
does the same, and assumes blank verse when he drops the
disguise.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "AS YOU LIKE IT"</p>

<p>1. How is the title of the play appropriately suggestive of
its tenor?</p>

<p>2. Compare Rosalind of this play with Juliet of "Romeo
and Juliet."</p>

<p>3. What is Rosalind's object in deceiving Orlando concerning
her identity?</p>

<p>4. What part does Touchstone take in the play?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "ROMEO AND JULIET"</p>

<p>1. Select several lines which indicate the outcome of this
youthful passion.</p>

<p>2. Both "As You Like It" and "Romeo and Juliet" have
the same theme&mdash;young lovers; compare the style of treatment
of each.</p>

<p>3. In each case does the language used suit the scene in
which the play is laid?</p>

<p>4. What difficulties does Romeo have to encounter to see
Juliet?</p>

<h4>JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE</h4>

<p class="center">(1749&ndash;1832)</p>

<p>The greatest literary genius that Germany has produced
was born and spent his early years at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
then capital of the German confederation. His later youth
was spent in preparation for the bar at Leipsic and Strasburg.</p>

<p>By 1775 he had rendered himself famous by his drama
"Götz von Berlichingen" and his novel, "The Sorrows of
Werther." In that year he removed to Weimar, which soon
because of him became the intellectual Mecca of Germany.
He found a true friend in Karl August, Duke of Weimar, and
throughout his long life occupied one after another of the chief
offices of that little state. In the succeeding years appeared
many dramas and other works, principal among the former
being "Iphigenia," "Tasso," and "Egmont."</p>

<p>The year 1789 witnessed the beginning of his acquaintance
with Schiller, then professor of history at Jena. Schiller had
established a literary journal "Die Horen," to which Goethe
contributed his "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship." And
in the same year, 1796, Goethe and Schiller wrote between
them some six hundred "Xenien," pithy sayings on the philosophic
tendencies of the age. The next year Goethe published
his "Hermann and Dorothea," a romance in verse and
one of his best works. Schiller removed to Weimar in 1799,
and Germany's two foremost poets worked together until the
death of Schiller in 1805.</p>

<p>Until his death, twenty-seven years later, Goethe was unceasingly
busy. Not satisfied with being preëminent in literature,
he plunged into anatomy, vegetable physiology, and
optics, in each of which, far from simply playing the amateur,
he rendered permanent service to science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout his whole life he labored at that greatest of all
German dramas, "Faust." Begun as early as 1774, it first
appeared in 1790 and then only as a 'fragment.' Urged by
Schiller, he took it up again, and in 1808 the First Part was
issued; the Second Part, only after his death, in 1833. This
Second Part is as deep in its thought and philosophy as any
poetic work that has been written; it has been the subject of
study and meditation by all the great thinkers since its publication.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. Give Heine's description of Goethe's personal appearance.
VI, 389.</p>

<p>2. What was Goethe's education?</p>

<p>3. Were Goethe's love affairs limited to his youth? IV,
372.</p>

<p>4. What part did Goethe take in scientific research? VI,
237.</p>

<p>5. What part did he take in political affairs?</p>

<p>6. Name three eminent writers who visited Goethe at
Weimar. VI, 377; VIII, 174, 180.</p>

<p>7. How late in life did Goethe retain his physical vigor?
IV, 403.</p>

<p>8. Did Goethe conceive of God as a personal being? I,
392.</p>

<p>9. What great composer was among his intimate friends?
I, 418.</p>

<p>10. See Goethe's forecast of the construction of the Panama
Canal by the United States. IV, 385.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. Give Goethe's own statement of his influence upon
German poetry and institutions. I, 170.</p>

<p>2. For what reason is Faust not fully appreciated by the
reading public? IV, 382.</p>

<p>3. What was Napoleon's opinion of Goethe's works? IV,
401.</p>

<p>4. During what portion of Goethe's life was "Faust"
written?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Name three other dramas of note by Goethe.</p>

<p>6. The position assigned to "Hermann and Dorothea"?</p>

<p>7. Who was the continuator of Goethe's work? I, 168.</p>

<p>8. What was Heine's opinion of Goethe? I, 169.</p>

<p>9. Was he the author of any prose works?</p>

<p>10. From what you read of him in I, 168-171; IV, 371 ff.;
VI, 388-390; VIII, 172 ff.; do you think he belonged to the
Age of Classicism or of Romanticism, or both? What conclusion
do you draw from his work, its subject-matter, and its
style?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "FAUST"</p>

<p>1. The selection from "Faust" includes practically the
whole tragedy of Margaret's temptation, and forms a complete
drama in itself. This is the central theme of the First
Part of "Faust"; in the Second Part Faust saves himself from
damnation by abandoning selfishness and solitude and becoming
a worker for the good of humanity, at one with the world.</p>

<p>2. What is Faust's first purpose?</p>

<p>3. Mephistopheles is to be regarded either as an evil spirit
or else as Faust's own baser side, endeavoring to defeat the
ideals of his better self.</p>

<p>4. What does the character of Martha add to the drama?</p>

<p>5. Compare with Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus," IX, 43, ff.</p>

<p>6. Which is the more immediately powerful? Both are
derived from a medieval tale and are related to the medieval
morality plays, in which virtues and vices are represented
struggling for the souls of men. Does Goethe or Marlowe
come nearer to this simple form of drama in style? in spirit?</p>

<h4>FRIEDRICH VON SCHILLER</h4>

<p class="center">(1759&ndash;1805)</p>

<p>Schiller, the most beloved of German poets, was a native
of the Duchy of Würtemberg. Abandoning the study of the
law for that of medicine, he gave vent to his literary powers by
writing the romantic drama of "The Robbers," produced in
1782. Meanwhile he had become regimental surgeon and was
obliged to leave his regiment without permission in order to
witness the performance. As a result he was put under arrest
and involved in further trouble, fleeing at last into hiding,
under a false name.</p>

<p>Drifting through the literary centers of Germany, studying
history and writing drama the while, he came in 1787 to
Weimar, where he was received kindly by the duke, Goethe's
patron and friend, and soon after met Goethe himself.
Through the latter's influence Schiller received a post at the
University of Jena as professor of history, and devoted himself
to that subject; his "History of the Thirty Years' War"
belongs to this period.</p>

<p>By 1795 he had become intimate with Goethe and renewed
his poetic work, his principal dramas and "The Song of the
Bell," all belonging to this period. Of the former, "Maria
Stuart" and "The Maid of Orleans" deserve high praise beside
his masterpieces, the "Wallenstein" trilogy, and "Wilhelm
Tell," his last and most popular play.</p>

<p>His character was noble and lovable, and his work possesses
a high finish in style and a lofty vein of idealism which gives
it a resemblance to those passages and plays of Shakespeare in
which princes and potentates appear. He was a lover of the
Bard of Avon and translated several of his plays into German.
But Schiller did not attempt the many-sided portrayal of life
that was Shakespeare's forte; for him the presentation of high
ideals and a majestic plot involving the great motives of human
action was sufficient.</p>

<p>Yet his thought is not so profound as Goethe's, and its expression,
on the other hand, is not so simple. The story of
Margaret's tragedy, in "Faust," is bare as compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the plots of "Tell" or "Maria Stuart" and the character
development therein; but the lesson which Goethe drove
home to the hearts of men was more forcible than any of
Schiller's.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. What terms of intimacy existed between Goethe and
Schiller? VIII, 182.</p>

<p>2. Was his education calculated to fit him for the calling
of a poet?</p>

<p>3. Was Jean Paul Richter right in supposing Schiller to be
of a strong nature? VIII, 175.</p>

<p>4. What was the nature of his connection with Jena?</p>

<p>5. In what respect did he resemble Shelley? VII, 222.</p>

<p>6. Where, and in whose company, were his latter years
spent?</p>

<p>7. Compare Goethe and Schiller in character and in work.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. In what two departments of literature did Schiller attain
eminence?</p>

<p>2. Which works treat of scenes outside of Germany?</p>

<p>3. Name his four greatest dramas.</p>

<p>4. Which of these is esteemed the masterpiece?</p>

<p>5. Which first brought him to public notice?</p>

<p>6. For what two great historical works are we indebted to
him?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "WILHELM TELL"</p>

<p>1. What are the social and political conditions in Switzerland
at the beginning of the play? How did they compare
with those of other lands?</p>

<p>2. From what class in society do the characters come? Is
their style of speech consistent with their social position? Is
absolute adherence to realism desirable? Why, and also why
not?</p>

<p>3. What is the date of this play and what great social upheavals
had recently taken place?</p>

<p>4. Why is Tell's son introduced?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Is the character of Gessler too harshly drawn?</p>

<p>6. The scene on p. 363 occurs at the close of the play; meanwhile
previous acts have shown the development of the spirit
of freedom in the hearts of the people and the determination
to do away with tyranny. Does this justify Tell's act?</p>

<p>7. "The Robbers" was one of the first products of Romanticism;
is "Tell" also a good example of this age?</p>

<p>8. Compare the style in "Tell" with that of Shakespeare
and Goethe, making allowance for loss in translation.</p>

<h4>CHARLES DICKENS</h4>

<p class="center">(1812&ndash;1870)</p>

<p>Charles Dickens was born at Portsmouth, England. His
parents were poor and luckless. His early years were spent
in moving from place to place, and as a boy he performed the
services of a drudge and was rewarded with a mere pittance.
Such education as he received was gained in the severe school
of experience.</p>

<p>Hence it is not surprising that, after having been connected
with various newspapers in a subordinate capacity, when he
finally tried his hand at serial fiction he astounded the world
in "Pickwick Papers" by his wonderful descriptions of middle
and lower class English life; a work also unexcelled in its
good-natured merriment.</p>

<p>"Pickwick Papers" and its successors were among the first
of those social novels which form so marked a feature of
modern literature. They waged open and successful warfare
against many of the crying evils of the day, such as the work-houses,
the barbarous school system in vogue, and the legal
and prison systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Dickens was too kind-hearted to sneer, but his mocking
humor was quite as effective. He won the hearts of high and
low alike, and the sale of his novels was phenomenal.</p>

<p>In addition to rollicking humor, touches of satire and a pronounced
tendency toward exaggerated pathos appear in his
work, the latter quality especially in "The Old Curiosity Shop"
and "Dombey and Son."</p>

<p>His creative powers were immense, the numbers of his
characters running into the hundreds. Though some of these
serve the purpose of lay figures, yet they are redeemed from
mere puppetry by some whimsical oddity that stamps the
character indelibly on one's mind. "David Copperfield,"
"Bleak House," and "Pickwick Papers" are usually held to
be the best of his work.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. Where did Dickens receive his education? Compare it
with that of other novelists.</p>

<p>2. Give the sources of his intimate acquaintance with conditions

of his satire?</p>

<p>4. What great quality will ever endear him to the public?</p>

<p>5. Where did Dickens make his home after his reputation
had become established? V, 220.</p>

<p>6. What was his attitude toward the poor after he had
become a man of substance?</p>

<p>7. Have social conditions in England improved since his
day? In what lines and how?</p>

<p>1. In what is Dickens related to the period of Romanticism?
Is he characteristically English? Compare him
with Dumas, Daudet, and Harte.</p>

<p>2. What beneficial effect has the reading of his novels had
on everyday life?</p>

<p>3. Explain his custom of running several stories at the

that crowd his pages?</p>

<p>6. What art lies at the bottom of his comic masterpiece?
III, 258.</p>

<p>7. To what extent have Dickens's characters become common
property of the race? III, 248.</p>

<p>8. How does Dickens compare with the other novelists of
the nineteenth century? III, 264.</p>

<p>9. Does Dickens's continued popularity prove the contention
that the public likes bad literature? III, 252.</p>

<p>10. Which novel will endure the longer, that in which the
characters are exaggerated and impossible, as his often
are, or that in which the characters are carefully and realistically
drawn? III, 266.</p>

Kipling? III, 249.</p>

<p>12. What work brought Dickens into public notice?</p>

<p>13. Name three novels in which pathos predominates.</p>

<p>14. Which is considered his greatest work?</p>

pathos, the one as a novelist, the other as a poet. Compare
them in these qualities.</p>

<h4>WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY</h4>

<p class="center">(1811&ndash;1863)</p>

<p>The novelist was born in Calcutta, India; he was sent to
Cambridge University. Here he was an intimate friend of
Tennyson and Fitzgerald (translator of the "Rubáiyát").
After losing his money in various newspaper deals, he settled
down in London as a literary hack. His genius soon attracted
the attention of "Punch," which welcomed his sketches and
satires against snobbery.</p>

<p>"Vanity Fair" in 1847 finally raised him to the highest
rank among writers of fiction. "Pendennis" followed, and a
little later "Henry Esmond," the equal of "Vanity Fair."
Its sequel, "The Virginians," was not so powerful.</p>

<p>Thackeray came to the United States in 1852 and delivered
his lectures on "The English Humorists." So pleased was he
with the country that he returned again three years later
and lectured on "The Four Georges." During these trips
he became acquainted with the leading American writers of
the day.</p>

<h4>SAMUEL JOHNSON</h4>

<p class="center">(1709&ndash;1784)</p>

<p>Johnson was born at Lichfield, Staffordshire, and studied
at Oxford. His early years were one continuous struggle
with poverty, first as a teacher at Lichfield and other places
and afterwards as a hack writer in London. During the latter
period, besides his ordinary duties as an editor of various
magazines, he found time to turn his hand to the most diverse
forms of literature. He wrote poems, "London" and the
"Vanity of Human Wishes"; a drama, "Irene"; a philosophic
romance, "Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia"; two series
of essays, the "Rambler" and the "Idler," after the model of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Addison's "Spectator"; and prepared the first English dictionary.</p>

<p>In 1862 he was granted a pension of £300 by Lord Bute,
from which time dates his literary dictatorship. His only
subsequent works of importance were his "Journey to the
Western Islands of Scotland" and his "Lives of the Poets."
The latter is his best work and one of the monuments of English
criticism in spite of its prejudiced tone.</p>

<p>During the latter half of his life he gathered about him a
coterie of the most intellectual men of the day, nearly all of
whom belonged to the literary society known as the Club.
Burke, Goldsmith, Gibbon, Garrick, Reynolds, and Boswell
were among his intimates.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. To see Johnson, the thinker and the man, read Boswell's
"Life," II, 100 ff., and then take up the following questions:</p>

questions?</p>

<p>3. Quote Goldsmith on his roughness of manner.</p>

<p>4. What was Johnson's opinion of the married state?</p>

<p>5. Would you judge him to have been of a harsh or tender
disposition?</p>

<p>6. See Frances Burney's account of his sociability. II,
339 ff.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. What peculiar position did Johnson occupy in the
literary world of his day?</p>

<p>2. If Johnson is to be called heroic for having kept at his
dictionary until its completion, why should not the term be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
applied to later lexicographers, whose dictionaries are much
more extensive?</p>

<p>3. Under what circumstances does Johnson justify dissimulation?</p>

<p>4. Was his criticism of Milton fair? VIII, 350.</p>

<p>5. Why was he a poor critic of the Latin productions of
modern writers? VIII, 354.</p>

<p>7. By what works is he best known?</p>

<p>8. Is he comparable with Addison as an essayist in your
opinion? Why?</p>

combinations of setting which would not hold in real life.</p>

<p>7. Judging from this selection, would the human race be
contented in utter idleness?</p>

<h4>OLIVER GOLDSMITH</h4>

<p class="center">(1728&ndash;1774)</p>

<p>Goldsmith was born in central Ireland, where his father
was a clergyman of the Established Church of England. His
youth gave little promise of future eminence. Educated at
Trinity College, Dublin, after various escapades he was sent
by his uncle to study medicine in Edinburgh. After a few
months of study he started on a four years' vagabond trip,
during which he made the tour of Western Europe on foot,
paying his way with his flute.</p>

<p>Returning to England he was by turns a physician, proofreader,
teacher, and hack writer. In the latter capacity he
came in contact with Dr. Johnson, and was one of the nine
charter members of the Club, a literary society over which
Johnson held genial sway. The next year appeared his first
work of any value, the poem, "The Traveler." A year later
he published his only novel, "The Vicar of Wakefield," still
one of the most popular of stories. From this he turned to
the drama and produced "The Good-Natured Man," and "She
Stoops to Conquer," the latter unsurpassed among later English
comedies. At some time prior to this appeared his
greatest poem, "The Deserted Village."</p>

<p>In character he was a strange mixture of generosity and
vanity; the butt and yet the envy of his many friends, uncouth
in appearance and yet gifted with so lucid a style.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. Goldsmith was educated at the same college as Burke:
did he benefit as greatly?</p>

<p>2. Under what circumstances did he make the tour of the
Continent?</p>

<p>3. Were his habits of dress eccentric? II, 115.</p>

<p>4. He was a member of what celebrated literary coterie?</p>

<p>5. What were his principal traits?</p>

<p>6. What was his opinion of his friend Johnson? II, 110,
122.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>3. Name the principal prose writers of his time. II, 100,

<p>6. What defects mar his writings?</p>

<p>7. Name three of his works in different departments of
literature, any one of which would have served to establish
his reputation.</p>

<p>8. What poem brought him into public notice?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">"THE DESERTED VILLAGE"</p>

<p>1. What is the economic effect on a community when one
large landholder possesses the entire land?</p>

<p>2. The "bold peasantry" of England are similar to what
class in America?</p>

<p>3. What was Goldsmith's ideal of a happy old age?</p>

<p>4. To what qualities of character was the attracting power
of the village preacher due?</p>

<p>5. What were the qualifications of a rustic school teacher
in Goldsmith's time?</p>

<p>6. Why is wealth a barren possession?</p>

<p>7. Name some of the disagreeable surroundings of a life in

the Renaissance, and "The Cotter's Saturday Night," II,

<h4>THOMAS GRAY</h4>

<p class="center">(1716&ndash;1771)</p>

<p>After studying at Eton and at Cambridge University, Gray
made the customary tour of the Continent and then settled
down to a retired life among his books. His circle of friends
was small but intellectual. He spent most of his life at Cambridge,
reading and thinking.</p>

<p>In disposition he was very reserved, seldom revealing his
feelings. As he was sensitive and also rather melancholy it
was natural that he should find few intimates. Always a
student, he none the less applied himself to those topics only
which attracted him, neglecting such portions of the subject
as did not appeal to him, so that although one of the most
learned men of his time he did not receive public recognition
until his appointment as regius professor of history and modern
languages at Cambridge, three years before his death.</p>

<p>The Age of Classicism, in which he lived, was repugnant to
him; its formal standards, as expressed especially by the
poetry of Pope, offended his fastidious taste, which was
charmed by the wild beauty of nature and longed for freedom
of expression and avoidance of convention in literary art.</p>

<p>He was the forerunner of the Romantic spirit. Had he
lived forty years later he would have been far more productive;
the poetry of Wordsworth, Byron, and the rest of that dazzling
group of poets would have strengthened and enthused him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>What little he wrote bears witness to the scholarship, refinement,
and depth of feeling of the recluse. His "Elegy,"
meditated in Stoke Pogis churchyard near his mother's home,
where he spent the summer, is probably the most thoroughly
English poem ever written. It was begun in 1742 and finished
in 1750; during the interval it was polished and revised so
effectively that not a word can be altered without detracting
from its symmetry and splendor. The dignity of the classic
spirit and the wistful grace of Romanticism are both apparent,
but the keynote is quiet, simple love of everyday life tinged
with moral reflection, the note sounded again and again in
English poetry and prose.</p>

<p>2. What was his nature?</p>

<p>3. How did he spend his life?</p>

<p>5. What influence did this period have upon Gray?</p>

<p>6. In what period would he have been more active?</p>

<h4>EDMUND BURKE</h4>

<p class="center">(1729&ndash;1797)</p>

<p>Edmund Burke was a native of Dublin, Ireland. After a
careful preparatory training, he entered Trinity College,
Dublin, where he showed marked ability in eloquence, history,
poetry, and philosophy. After receiving his master's degree,
he went to England, with the intention of becoming a barrister,
but found the profession not to his taste. He accordingly
spent the next six years making the tour of Great Britain and
the Continent, and forming the acquaintance of the leading
literary men.</p>

<p>The first years after his return to England were devoted to
literary work, resulting in two philosophical essays, "Vindication
of Natural Society," and "The Sublime and Beautiful."
He also collaborated with his cousin William Burke in "An
Account of the European Settlements in America."</p>

<p>But he soon turned his attention to politics. In 1766 he
was elected to Parliament, of which he remained a member for
twenty-eight years. He held many other positions under the
Government, and his actions were always distinguished by the
strictest integrity. He labored earnestly in the cause of
humanity, against the slave trade and the oppression of India
and the American Colonies. His most widely read works are
his "Speech at the Trial of Warren Hastings," and the speech
on "Conciliation with America." But owing to his increas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>ing
conservatism he failed to appreciate the causes of the
French Revolution and his "Reflections on the Revolution in
France" is of little critical value.</p>

<p>Burke was distinguished by great nobility of mind and
purity of life, both public and private. He possessed great
oratorical powers, a vigorous imagination, a rare gift of observation,
and prodigious industry.</p>

<p>Yet on the other hand, he appears not to have known how
to contain himself, but scattered his eloquence on all occasions,
until the public ear became dulled. He was also of a passionate
and intractable disposition, qualities which in the
course of time left him in political isolation.</p>

<p>Among his friends were Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith, Boswell,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, the famous painter, and Garrick, the
great actor. These were members of the Club, a society of the
most brilliant intellects in England at that day. Burke's
learning and power were greatly venerated by them, and by
none more than by Johnson, who admitted that he must be
at his best to meet Burke in argument.</p>

<h4>DANIEL WEBSTER</h4>

<p class="center">(1782&ndash;1852)</p>

<p>Born at Salisbury (now Franklin), New Hampshire,
Daniel Webster received his education at Dartmouth College.
He afterward studied law and then removed to Massachusetts,
where he soon obtained distinction as a politician,
and was in 1812 sent to Congress. He championed the New
England cause against the embargo and the other measures
of the administration, yet although his great oratorical
powers were already manifest, he displayed little of that
breadth of character which afterwards distinguished him.</p>

<p>To the years which followed we owe some of his most
popular forensic efforts and public addresses, the "Dartmouth
College Case," the "Girard Will," and the addresses at
Plymouth and Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>In 1827 he was elected to the United States Senate. Three
years later he delivered his masterpiece, "The Reply to
Hayne," on the floor of the Senate. Under Presidents Harrison
and Tyler he was Secretary of State, and was instrumental in
negotiating the celebrated "Webster-Ashburton Treaty."</p>

<p>For many years the leading man of the Whig party, his
presidential aspirations were doomed to disappointment.
His last years in the Senate were, like those of Clay, consecrated
to the effort to preserve the Union. But his pleas for
compromise fell in the North on dull ears, and his pleas for
concessions to the South were looked on as treason. The
time for compromise was passing.</p>

<p>The Whigs being returned to power in 1850, Webster again
became Secretary of State, but again failing to secure the
nomination for President, he returned to Marshfield, where,
after a brief illness, he died in October, 1852.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. Of what college was Webster a graduate?</p>

<p>2. State the extent to which he filled the public eye at the
time of his death. III, 271.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In what respect did he "wear the double wreath of
professional and public supremacy"? III, 273.</p>

<p>4. What ties bound him to New Hampshire, and what to
Massachusetts? III, 275.</p>

<p>5. As a statesman, what division of the country did Webster
especially represent?</p>

<p>6. To what political party did he adhere?</p>

<p>7. To what do you ascribe the unpopularity which embittered
his declining years?</p>

<p>8. What important public positions did he fill?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">FROM "REPLY TO HAYNE"</p>

<p>1. State the "nullification doctrine" propounded by
Senator Hayne.</p>

<p>2. Why does Webster defend Massachusetts against the
charge of having formerly attempted to nullify an act of
Congress?</p>

<p>3. Explain the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'impracticability'">impracticality</ins> of state nullification.</p>

<p>4. Was the federal government created by the States?</p>

<p>5. State how the mere existence of the federal constitution
implies the subordination of the States.</p>

<p>6. Show how Webster brings ridicule of his opponent to the
aid of his argument.</p>

<p>7. What would be the inevitable and direct result of
nullification?</p>

<p>8. Do you think the statement of Webster that he was
"drawn into the debate, with no previous deliberation," etc.,
to be literally true?</p>

<p>9. Read carefully the peroration, pp. 281-283; one of
the grandest passages in American eloquence.</p>

<p>10. Does Webster show the influence of the classics as
well as the moderns? Compare his style with that of Demosthenes,
IV, 161.</p>

<h4>PLATO</h4>

<p class="center">(427 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>&ndash;347 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>)</p>

<p>An Athenian by birth, Plato's youth was spent in the
midst of the tumult and gloom in which Athens, the flower of
Greek civilization, fell victim to her greed and arrogance and
succumbed to the sturdy, rising power of Sparta. But his
maturity and later years saw the growth of a purified and
enlightened spirit of culture which raised Greek thought
above local pettiness and prepared for the day of alliance with
Roman enterprise.</p>

<p>His youth was passed under the inspiring guidance of
Socrates, whose searching inquiries into the depths of human
nature marked the beginning of the loftiest philosophy of
ancient times. Plato, and Aristotle, his pupil, carried on
the work begun by Socrates, involving the discussion of
the entire experience of Greek life and the criticism of its
principles.</p>

<p>Upon the condemnation and death of Socrates in 399 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>
the circle of his disciples was broken up, Plato fleeing with
others to Megara. He spent the next twelve years in travel,
visiting most of the centers of learning of the ancient world.
On his return to Athens about 388 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span> he founded the famous
school of the Academy, and settled down to the study and
teaching of philosophy.</p>

<p>His teachings have come down to us in the form of dialogues
between Socrates and his disciples, but as they were written
for the purpose of setting forth Plato's system of philosophy,
which differed in some respects from that of Socrates, we do
not of course know to what extent the narrative is colored.
It would appear, however, that in the simpler dialogues, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
as the "Apology," "Crito," "Laches," and "Charmides," we
may possess the unvarnished teachings of Socrates.</p>

<p>In some of his later dialogues the speculative interest is
allowed to become so absorbing that the dialogue form is
rather inappropriate; but the others have been generally
acknowledged as comprising the greatest masterpieces of
dialogue that literature has to show, in the skill with which
the scene is suggested, the charm of the conversation, and
the artistic truth with which the characters are set forth in
the changing course of the discussion.</p>

<p>The "Republic" is the best summing up of his philosophy.
In it is best represented his Theory of Ideas, which has
made his work the great type of idealistic philosophy.</p>

<p>He ranks with Aristotle and Kant as one of the three greatest
thinkers of all ages.</p>

<h4>AURELIUS</h4>

<p class="center">(121 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>&ndash;180 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>)</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius (Antoninus), emperor and philosopher,
was the child of noble parents. His wonderful character,
both intellectual and moral, early attracted the attention of
the emperor, Hadrian, who, when Marcus had attained his
seventeenth year, adopted Antoninus Pius as his successor,
upon the condition that the latter adopt Marcus.</p>

<p>Accordingly Marcus was adopted by Pius, who proceeded
to lavish upon him as heir presumptive to the Empire every
position for which his high character and thorough education
fitted him; and upon the death of Pius he ascended the
throne, at the age of forty.</p>

<p>His reign covered a period of nineteen years, over two-thirds
of which he spent on the borders of the empire in ceaseless
struggles to sustain the tottering empire against the
ravages of the outer barbarians.</p>

<p>It was during these campaigns that his "Meditations," or
"Thoughts," his only work, was written. In its present
form, at least, it was never intended for publication, nor is it
probable that it was, as some think, written for the instruction
of his son, Commodus. It was written in Greek, and consists
of mere memoranda, disconnected thoughts, and confessions,
evidently hastily noted, a circumstance which accounts
for its repetitions, its obscurity, and its elliptical form of
expression. But in spite of this it has been an inspiration to
the despondent in all ages. Its tone and temper are sweet yet
dignified, courageous yet resigned, philosophical and speculative
yet intensely practical. It stands preëminent among
those world-books which teach men how to live and how to die.</p>

<p>The great blots on his memory, in popular estimation, are
the massacres of Christians in his reign, and his blindness
to the frailty of his wife and the worthlessness of his son.
But the Christians were in those days commonly looked upon
as a pernicious secret cult, and those who comprehend his
philosophy will know why he could see only good in the
members of his family.</p>

<h4>FRANCIS BACON</h4>

<p class="center">(1561&ndash;1626)</p>

<p>Francis Bacon was born three years before his great contemporary,
William Shakespeare, but survived him many
years. He was born in high station and had every educational
advantage which the times afforded. He was the nephew
of William Cecil, Elizabeth's great minister, and, entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
public life, himself became the favorite minister of James I and
Lord High Chancellor of England. But his character was
not in keeping with his literary merits and ability. He was
venal and corrupt, took bribes as a judge and sold justice for a
price. He has been called the wisest and meanest of mankind.</p>

<p>By the introduction of the inductive method in logic,
Bacon overthrew the scholastic system and facilitated the
study of modern science. It is true the inductive method
was known before Bacon, but it had been in general neglected.
The great philosophical works which accomplished this revolution
were the "Advancement of Learning," and the "Novum
Organum." The latter and others of his metaphysical works
were written in Latin in order to reach a wider circle of readers!</p>

<p>His "Essays" are the best known and most popular of his
writings. The style is all his own; elaborate, sententious,
often witty, often metaphorical, and possessing a degree of
conciseness rarely found in the compositions of the Elizabethan
age. Every sentence is pregnant with thought. He alone of
the writers of his time strikes straight at the root of the matter.</p>

<p>What peculiarly impresses one in his "Essays" is the undoubted
truthfulness of the propositions advanced, and the
manner in which he illuminates his thought by the form in
which he casts it. The slight tinge of casuistry noticeable
in his writings is in keeping with the times.</p>

<p>The "Essays" were at first mere jottings down of desultory
ideas, mere note-book memoranda. They were revised and
expanded from time to time until they reached their present
shape.</p>

<h4>THOMAS CARLYLE</h4>

<p class="center">(1795&ndash;1881)</p>

<p>Carlyle was the son of a stone mason. He entered the
University of Edinburgh at the age of thirteen and remained
there five years, proving himself an omnivorous reader but
impractical in many respects, so that he took no degree.
After several years of hardship in Scotland as a teacher and
a hack writer he married Jane Welsh, whose intellect was
almost the equal of his own and whose eccentricity of temper
was also similar to his, with the result that much of their
life was marred by bickering; yet there is no question of
their mutual affection. After a long fight against poverty
in London, he eventually won the esteem of Europe for his
bold personality and titanic literary power and died full of
years and honors, but sensitive and harsh to the last. It is
only fair to mention that he was the victim of lifelong dyspeptic
trouble and the depression resultant therefrom.</p>

<p>His writings all make a study of life, seeking the answer
in the lives of the great men, the Heroes, whether of literature
or of history. His early studies in German literature, especially
the work of Goethe, influenced him not only in his outlook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
on the universe but in his literary style. Sacrificing everything
to force, he adopts every expedient to drive home each
point in the lesson he wishes to convey. This intense earnestness
and unprecedented unconventionality, although united
with phenomenal descriptive powers, resulted in an ungainly
style, yet so filled with sincerity and the hatred of shams and
falsity as to hold and inspire not merely a select circle of
readers but a whole nation. His influence was that of a living
personality, a prophet to all English-speaking peoples.</p>

<p>"Sartor Resartus" expresses the doubts and hesitancies of
youth, when confronted with the materialism and apparent
relentlessness of nature, together with the bold, sturdy defiance
which youth's courage creates for its protection. In
"Heroes and Hero-Worship," the "Essay on Burns," "The
French Revolution," and the "History of Frederick the
Great" he holds up examples of heroism as he sees them,
searchingly and vividly. So in the "Life of John Sterling,"
he studies the character of one of his dearest friends,
recently dead, and there finds the same qualities of manly
nobility. His work becomes not only biographical but historical,
obviously, and such volumes as "Past and Present"
and "Latter-Day Pamphlets" attack flagrant weaknesses of
his day. Work that is so daring and furious in tone could not
be utterly free from error; his conclusions are not always
justified. Yet he will always remain the prophet and seer
of his century.</p>

<h4>JOHN RUSKIN</h4>

<p class="center">(1819&ndash;1900)</p>

<p>The son of a Scotch millionaire who had settled in London,
Ruskin received from private masters the best possible preparation
for his future and also traveled extensively with his
father and mother. Shortly after his graduation from Oxford
he astonished the world with the first volume of "Modern
Painters," a work designed primarily to show the superiority
of Turner, and a few other modern artists, over the older
painters of landscape; in later volumes he wanders over the
whole field of art criticism, the burden of his advice being a
return to the study of nature itself.</p>

<p>"The Seven Lamps of Architecture" discusses the moral
principles which should underlie architecture. This subject
was suggested to him by his continual studies of the work of
painters and architects in Italy and France while in pursuit
of material for his earlier work. "The Stones of Venice"
carries on the task set in both these works, namely the problem
of the moral basis underneath all art, the purpose which should
lie at the back of the artist's mind.</p>

<p>As he grew older his religious views, formerly rather narrow,
became broader, in common with the progress of the times,
yet he laid more and more stress on the need of upright and
godly character in all who have any purpose of attempting
good work.</p>

<p>His later volumes, then, are filled with this moral teaching
and also take up the errors of the social conditions of the period.
Old age pensions, state education, radical improvements in
the houses and home life of the common people were among
the needs which he saw, now accomplished, but then regarded
as rampant and foolish socialism.</p>

<p>In his style, as in his theories, there is a tendency to exaggerate,
a fault that is common among reformers, as in the cases
of Dickens and Carlyle. But the lofty ideals which he maintained
and the grace and power of his style far more than
atone for the occasional error of overstatement. In "Præterita,"
a brilliant autobiographical fragment, he accounts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the rare clarity and beauty of his style, for it was his custom
for many years during his childhood and youth to read the
Bible through aloud to his mother every year in daily selections.
The simplicity and majesty of the Biblical language
left its impress on his own prose.</p>

<p>His economic theories have not been adopted in England or
elsewhere, but he himself lived up to them and spent his whole
fortune in the philanthropic endeavor to put his plans for the
betterment of the working classes into operation. In spite
of the fact that his fortune was great and that he received as
much as $20,000 a year royalty from the sale of his works in
his latter days, his property at the time of his death was
inconsiderable.</p>

<h4>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</h4>

<p class="center">(1803&ndash;1882)</p>

<p>Emerson, the 'Sage of Concord,' was born a Bostonian,
of the ecclesiastical class. He prepared for the ministry and
for some time occupied a Unitarian pulpit; but, disagreeing
with his congregation as to the nature of the Lord's Supper,
he resigned his charge and became a public lecturer, a popular
profession in ante-bellum days when every community had
its Literary Society, or else its Debating Club. His home
from 1833, or for the last fifty years of his life, was at Concord,
Massachusetts. He shares with Longfellow the distinction
of being the best known abroad of all American
writers. No other American has measurably approached him
as an essayist.</p>

<p>He is a transcendentalist of the most advanced school.
Where he wishes to be clear, no one can be clearer, but he
often chooses to clothe his thoughts in mystery. This trait
is also noticeable in his poems, some of which glitter like
diamonds, while others are enigmatic and baffling. His
poetry is like his essays in being pointed and laconic, but
while this may be a merit in the essay, it is not so in poetry,
and his verse can hardly be considered first class. Few people
read his poetry except as an adjunct to the study of his essays.</p>

<p>He had no reasoned and complete system of philosophy,
but, like Bacon, merely gave birth to grand principles from
which a new philosophy was to spring. He resembles Bacon
also in that he oftentimes does not reason, but utters the
truth oracularly.</p>

<h4>HEINRICH HEINE</h4>

<p class="center">(1799&ndash;1856)</p>

<p>Heinrich Heine, the nephew of a rich Hamburg Jew, is
the most gifted German lyric poet since Goethe. Intended
for the bar, he studied at Bonn, Göttingen, and Berlin. He
then traveled extensively for some years, until publication
of his "Journey in the Hartz Mountains" and "Book of Songs"
brought him to public notice.</p>

<p>But his tactless attacks on various authors, and upon
several of the petty German governments of the day began
to make his native country an uncomfortable place, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
1831 he removed to Paris. His chief occupation there was
as correspondent for German newspapers. His long poems,
"Deutschland" and "Atta Troll," were written during this
period. For the last eight years of his life he was confined to
his bed, suffering terrible agonies from a disease of the spinal
column.</p>

<p>Though born a Jew and baptized into the Christian faith,
he was neither Jew nor Christian; and his character was
marred by many defects.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. In what city was he born? I, 171.</p>

<p>2. When did he take up his residence in Paris? I, 176.</p>

<p>4. And how have they affected the character of his writings?

<p>8. What position does he occupy among the German lyric
poets of the nineteenth century?</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. Upon what service to modern society does Heine's
fame rest? I, 167.</p>

<p>2. Of what great German writer is he the continuator? I,
168.</p>

<p>3. Did he have a true conception of Goethe's work? I,

<p>4. Upon what grounds did Heine prefer the French spirit
to that of the Germans and English? I, 172, 173.</p>

<h4>PLINY</h4>

<p class="center">(61 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>&ndash;113? <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>)</p>

<p>Pliny the Younger was born in the year <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> 61, at Como,
Italy. Like most famous Roman writers whose works have
come down to us, he was of high station. He accompanied
his uncle, Pliny the Elder, when the latter was summoned
to Rome by the Emperor Vespasian in <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> 72, and devoted
several years to the study of Roman and Greek literature
under the best instructors.</p>

<p>After the death of his uncle, in 79, he made his appearance
as an advocate, a profession in which he won great eminence.
Ten years later he entered upon an official career of remarkable
success, holding in succession most of the great offices of the
Roman State, until in 111 he was selected by Trajan as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Governor of Bithynia. His correspondence ceases in 113, and
nothing is known of his life thereafter.</p>

<p>While moving in the highest circles, the intimate of Tacitus,
Suetonius, Martial, and all of the senatorial class, he was
distinguished by great conscientiousness and public spirit,
endowing temples, baths, libraries, and schools. He was humane
and even affectionate toward his slaves and courteous
to his dependents.</p>

<p>He sought fame as a poet and orator, as well as letter-writer,
but neither his "Panegyric on Trajan," nor the two sets of
verses which alone have escaped the ravages of time, would
indicate that the world is much the worse for the loss of the
remainder of his orations and poems.</p>

<p>But in his "Letters" he conferred an inestimable boon on
future ages. They are voluminous, in ten books, and covering
almost every topic of the times, our most valuable commentary
upon Roman life in the second century after Christ.
They were undoubtedly written with a direct view to publication,
for he is careful to confine each one to a single topic,
and generally closes it with an epigrammatic point. But
they are models of graceful thought and refined expression.
Only twice is any one of whom an unfavorable opinion is
expressed mentioned by name.</p>

<p>The tenth book, the "Correspondence with Trajan," is
valuable for another reason&mdash;for the light it throws on early
Christianity. It reflects the greatest credit on the strict and
almost punctilious conscientiousness of Pliny, and on the
assiduity and high principle which animated the Emperor.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">THE MAN</p>

<p>1. What does Pliny the Elder say of the form of money
used in early Rome? XI, 189.</p>

<p>2. To what class of society did Pliny the Younger belong?</p>

<p>3. Give a brief account of the death of his uncle.</p>

<p>4. What other author do you associate with the Lake of
Como? I, 8, illustration.</p>

<p>5. What regular profession did Pliny follow during the
earlier years of his life? The latter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Locate Bithynia on the map. Also Lake Como. (See
classical atlas.)</p>

<p>7. What authors were intimate associates of Pliny?</p>

<p>8. Enumerate the good points in his character.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">STYLE AND WORKS</p>

<p>1. In what way does Pliny say we may add to the length
of our lives? V, 71.</p>

<p>2. Are his writings confined to his "Letters"?</p>

<p>3. Of what special use are the "Letters" to us?</p>

<p>4. How do we know that Pliny wrote his letters with
publication in mind?</p>

<p>5. What does he say of Phidias's attention to detail in his
sculpture? VI, 359.</p>

<p>6. Why should his correspondence with Trajan be of
special interest to us?</p>

<p>7. What do we glean from the correspondence as to the
character of Trajan?</p>

<p>8. Compare his account of the destruction of Pompeii
with that of Lytton. VIII, 285.</p>

<p>9. State what proficiency the Romans had attained in the
art of landscape gardening.</p>

<p>10. What would you judge to have been the climate of
Tuscany, from the allusion to plane, cypress, and other trees
and plants mentioned?</p>

<p>11. What reason lay behind the persecution of the Christians?
Do you think it was entirely religious?</p>

<p>12. What was the social condition of Rome at this time?</p>

<p>13. Did persecution lessen the number of adherents to
Christianity?</p>

<p>14. What was Pliny's estimate of this religion?</p>

<p>15. Was Trajan a just ruler, if his short letter be taken as
an indication of his character?</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
